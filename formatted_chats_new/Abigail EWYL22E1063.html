<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/05/23, 17:35 - Abigail EWYL22E1063:  Servant leadership style is based on the idea that leaders prioritize serving the greater good. Leaders with this style serve their team and organization first. They don’t prioritize their own objectives. Servant leadership seeks to achieve a vision by providing strong support to employees allowing  employees to learn and grow while bringing their own expertise and vision to the table. The Edoofa program founders have always been passionate about making a difference in people's lives through education.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/05/23, 13:13 - Abigail EWYL22E1063:  Leadership skills can play a large role in a person's career development and are considered critical traits necessary to get to the top of any career field. In order to master the skill of leadership, the EWYL program, through projects, assists in learning and developing professional skills, for example, communication skills and critical thinking. Communication skills are critical to being an effective leader, whether it's presenting in front of the team, creating and writing a business strategy, or communicating with employees and clients. Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly and rationally and to understand the logical connection between ideas. creative thinking—that is, being able to think about something in a fresh way outside the box and finding a new approach to solving a problem. In order to ensure that I will be on the next list of student leaders, I will have to be dedicated, hardworking, and put maximum effort into my work. These projects will definitely make a difference and contribute to your overall development.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 17:40 - Abigail EWYL22E1063:  Self-awareness is an important skill to develop in the workplace, especially for young professionals in the initial years of their professional careers. It is one of the 10 life skills recognized by the WHO-World Health Organization and is key to building the life that one aspires to have. An example of this is Barack Obama, who was one of the most introverted presidents and the first black president of free America. Obama realized that he is the most productive when in solitude and has always shared how he leads a sedentary life. Obama's success can be attributed to his introverted personality and ability to prioritize his schedule.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 17:58 - Ananya:  Yes, and I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/06/23, 18:04 - Ananya:  Now, Abigail! I was just discussing productivity and the importance of seriousness in day-to-day life with a few of my students. Some of them expressed concerns about a decline in their performance and expressed a desire to address this issue. Hence, I thought about asking each student about their individual weaknesses and working together to overcome them. You see, I firmly believe that striving for perfection is both impossible and unnecessary. However, in order to make progress in life and stand out from the crowd, it's important to continuously strive to become a better version of ourselves. So, I wanted to inquire if you have ever encountered a situation where you identified a personal weak point and felt the need to rectify it.</div></div>
