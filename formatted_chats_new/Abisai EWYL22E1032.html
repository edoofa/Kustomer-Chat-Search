<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/05/23, 17:48 - Abisai EWYL22E1032:  From the Wednesday lesson,I understand that there is servant leadership,one which is different from the traditional leadership that has been there throughout world history.Servant leadership is a form of leadership where the leader is the one who serve his people or his employees,making sure they achieve their goals and get what they want  before the leader do.An example of of servant leadership may be the founders of Edoofa,they have been passionate about changing lives  now a strong constant effort is observed from their end in the growth  and development of everyone in the Edoofa family.Servant leaders are characterized by some of the following characteristics; empathy, listening,persuasion,foresight and healing.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">19/05/23, 18:03 - Ananya:  Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/05/23, 22:09 - Abisai EWYL22E1032:  The projects and newsletters are a very important part of my EWYL program because they transmogrify my views towards the world around me and they also insert that leadership characteristic in me.The newsletters introduce the characterictics and personality required for one to become a good leader.I learnt about being a good leader and also the ways  to connect with the society that I'm living in.I'm willing to keep on learning and I can say that I know  I'm going to keep learning and develop.That's one of the reasons why I say today,'I am a proud Edoofian'.I remember from lesson 1,when I learnt about the important virtue,humility,sharing opportunities with the community,moving forward  to learn about being a hero,harming myself to improve,motivate and inspire the people around me.I also learnt about  being a serving leader,which is more like to be a hero to the community around,having empathy,listening and being able to heal other students as well as other people mentally,and so many other things that makes me feel proud of the opportunity to be an Edoofian.Project 1,2 and 3 are so important.From the projects,I learn to face failure and rejections which help me build a never giving up attitide.The projects also teach me to share opportunities and create an impact in people's lives,improve my communication skills and most importantly I reach out to leaders and other people who are influential.Having great  opportunities like this,to learn everyday to become a good leader build a secure future for me and I'm really grateful for a wonderful opportunity like this.By reading the newsletters carefully and working on my projects keeping in mind to follow instructions and being open minded,I believe I can be a good leader in the students' community.Last but not least,I have to lead by example,I need to achieve the goals I set for myself by dedicating my time and being consistent.Achieving my goals inspire and motivate the people around me and they get a chance to achieve their own goals,just like what Michael Jordan did.He was consistent with his goals and because of that he inspired Kobe and Lebron and Kobe inspired Giannis.All of them are now considered  best players in NBA and it is like an energy of inspiration from Jordan because he led by example.</div></div>

Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.</div></div>
