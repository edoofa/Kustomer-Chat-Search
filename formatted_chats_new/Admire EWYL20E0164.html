We should not give up even if they are little or no  reasons and most of all we should not get lazy because this is one of the most dangerous behaviour that might destroy all goals and dreams</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 19:46 - Unknown:  Now continuing our conversation Admire,  You know why SWOT Analysis is important? It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance. If you use it carefully and collaboratively, it can deliver new insights on where your business currently is, and help you to develop exactly the right strategy for any situation.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 19:46 - Unknown:  For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.</div></div>
