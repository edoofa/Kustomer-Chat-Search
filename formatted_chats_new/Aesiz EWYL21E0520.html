<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 20:23 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 00:43 - Unknown:  Hello Aesiz, Hope you are doing well. I think this is a serious issue. I will definitely get the same passed on to the Admissions team.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 00:44 - Unknown:  May I know if and When you have shared the  above concern with the Admissions team?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 00:50 - Unknown:  Aesiz I have just had a word with Admissions team</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 00:50 - Unknown:  After 5th July they have not received any response from you, Kindly check your admission group and talk to the team immediately.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 02:42 - Aesiz EWYL21E0520:  I had not shared the above concern with them</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 02:43 - Aesiz EWYL21E0520:  There are the ones who are supposed to give me some updates</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 02:45 - Aesiz EWYL21E0520:  Last time we talked they said that they are having discussions with LPU concerning some financial benefits. I was told to be patient whilst awaiting feedback. Technically it they had the feedback, wasn't l supposed to be informed? They never told me the conclusions from the discussion. There was no response from me needed, rather l am waiting for their feedback</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 05:07 - Unknown:  I understand Aesiz, But be assured I will try to help you solve this as soon as possible,  As it's already late, let us connect tomorrow and continue our session. Have a Blessed Evening.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 03:55 - Unknown:  Hello Aesiz, How are you today?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
