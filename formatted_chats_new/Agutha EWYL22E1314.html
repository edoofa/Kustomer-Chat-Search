<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:52 - Saloni Rastogi:  Agutha every day in the morning you are supposed to follow the daily ritual</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:53 - Saloni Rastogi:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:53 - Saloni Rastogi:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:57 - Agutha EWYL22E1314:  I will do exactly just that, thank you ma'am</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:57 - Agutha EWYL22E1314:  Yes that's very correct ma'am</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 14:04 - Agutha EWYL22E1314:  I have always wanted to become a person person to help other people by sharing the little knowledge that I have. All because of Edoofa it's now a dream come true because I'm helping students to join this amazing program. With all this I will happily say *that* *I* *am* *a* *proud* *Edoofian*.</div></div>
