<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 00:39 - Saloni Rastogi:  Greetings Aisha!</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 00:39 - Saloni Rastogi:  I know we have both been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now and I very well know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 00:42 - Aisha EWYL22E0710:  Thank you</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 18:51 - Saloni Rastogi:  Good morning Aisha!</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi:  Please follow the daily ritual for today.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi:  I hope you remeber that.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 18:56 - Saloni Rastogi:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 18:56 - Saloni Rastogi:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/11/22, 21:30 - Saloni Rastogi:  I am glad to see your enthusiasm to follow the daily ritual, but I would like to correct you a bit here. The daily ritual is 'I am a proud edoofian' and not 'I am proud to be an edoofian'.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/11/22, 21:31 - Saloni Rastogi:  I hope you will keep that in mind.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/11/22, 22:04 - Saloni Rastogi:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.

Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.
