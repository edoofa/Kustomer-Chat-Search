I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. RitualsÂ motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">28/07/22, 20:38 - Alice EWYL22E0414:  l understood that Time management is the key to success and is the ability to use your time productively and efficiently or it is the art of having time to do everything without being about it .People who are able to use their time wisely are also good at prioritising and they can do this due to understanding the difference between urgent and important of how something he or she wants to do is.This can be done due to the use of The Priority Matrix which is the best in reviewing your daily tasks.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">28/07/22, 22:54 - Jasmine Kaur:  Many successful people have different approaches that got them to where they are today. But the one thing they have in common is that they know how to juggle high-level projects and make sure they spend the bulk of their time on the tasks that are most conducive to their success.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/08/22, 22:30 - Jasmine Kaur:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.
