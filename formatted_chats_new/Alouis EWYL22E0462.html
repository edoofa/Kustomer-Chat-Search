<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">23/12/22, 23:30 - Alouis EWYL22E0462:  1. In a few years I will be alumni of Edoofa. So as someone who once got educated through Edoofa, I think giving back to Edoofa would be best. I will help Edoofa establish more campuses financially. If it is possible it would be best to establish Edoofa campuses in countries like USA which offer very good education.</div></div>
