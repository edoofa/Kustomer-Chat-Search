As Ms Davi highlighted, the main key points being shared in almost every success story is the spirit of never giving up. One has to be propelled by his own thrive to succeed. I have to work extra hard ,no matter how many times I might fail, the goal is to be on top so I should keep going. I loved how Mr Motsepe kept aiming for the best. He never settled for anything less that what he really wanted. I will note him down and research more about him. Thank you</div></div>

I worked in the business very well hand in hand with the owner such that the business took a fast paced expansion from the place we were at. As I worked with no supervision and with transparency the owner liked me and admired my hardwork. I treated customers very well that they were actually leaving the shops they used to buy in to come to my shop, plus the prices were exceptionally good. This is what happened the owner is a teacher  who had the money , so when he asked me how to make it 100% fast growing, I highlighted on the importance of small profits making quick returns.

Apart from doing the books I began to be given orders of what was needed in the shops and he would give me his commuter omnibus to do everything when he was at work. I am a precise person such that I bought only what was on the list, his business shot green and it made him happy.
