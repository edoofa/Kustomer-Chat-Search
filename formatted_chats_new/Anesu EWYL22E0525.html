<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/11/22, 22:14 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/11/22, 00:31 - Anesu EWYL22E0525:  Greetings to you as well.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/11/22, 00:32 - Anesu EWYL22E0525:  My EWYL group name is Anesu EWYL22E0525 and my mentor is Riva Singh.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">09/11/22, 18:29 - Unknown:  Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">09/11/22, 19:35 - Anesu EWYL22E0525:  Ok I understand, I will adopt the practice.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">09/11/22, 19:37 - Unknown:  Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">09/11/22, 19:51 - Anesu EWYL22E0525:  I have understood that the mantle of Edoofian is not one to take lightly as it brings on the responsibility and privilege of being part of a community oriented toward bringing about change and making a difference, as such it should be a daily mantra of sorts as a way of reminding this notion thus ensuring that I don't drop the ball on this wonderful opportunity. My intent as a proud Edoofian is to adopt this practise everyday during our interaction times.</div></div>
