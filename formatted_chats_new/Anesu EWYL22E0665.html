Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/06/23, 23:37 - Anesu EWYL22E0665:  As a student and young person I do agree with the idea that we achieve more and feel better-as a collective whole . Individualism is important but so is me working in a group or society where everyone invites benefits from the experience,when working together one gets to learn new skills and broadens their horizons from those interactions. Our friendships show us the places we ought to work on as individuals and help some thrive from those experiences because sometimes people’s skills are showcased during moments of stress and what other place or situation than in a group. As my weekly activity since I have opted for a path towards success with edoofa program,in my respective school I have taken it upon my self to tell my peers in the benefit of the program for instance hiw the program will help one reach their goals and help the community of Africa,how the Edoofa program will help its members or students to secure jobs or Atleast equip them with the knowledge and skills to tackle every diverse situation. I have tried my best to make them realize that Edoofa is the best option and now it is left for them to decide. Myself and some edoofian students from the school I attend have taken it upon ourselves to help each other be it in studies or projects thus building strong relationships,we created a group where one talks about the productive thing they would have done during the week and ask for help when needed. As students we are helping each other build strong individual and group networks .</div></div>
