<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">01/10/23, 19:19 - Anesuishe EWYL22E1011:  And yesterday I also failed to connect with you because my line wasn't functioning well it had zero network bars.Im sorry if I made a bad version of myself but honestly speaking it has not been easy for me to adjust and get what I needed ASAP.I even attended the webinar through another colleagues phone</div></div>

In my own words in brief I have understood that these are the core values of an ideal servant leader as they  are the people's person ,they get to understand the people's needs and wants and when making decision they will know the future and current impacts.These core values are a form of great motivation to followers and hence enlighten the people being served making the future and current world situation a healthy and loving one and so the world will give birth to greatness and success because of good leaders who would have inspired them.</div></div>
