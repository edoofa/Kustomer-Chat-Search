They are willing to connect with us but they want a letter from the ministry that permits me to visit schools about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so that we can make it official.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">09/10/23, 18:52 - Jasmine Kaur:  I'm pleased to hear that your day has been productive, Angel. Regarding the school's request for documents from the ministry, I want to clarify our primary objective. Your task was to visit the school, approach the headmaster, and inquire about their willingness to complete the required form. Once we have their consent and they understand our program's vision, we can proceed with further communication on WhatsApp. It's essential to secure their agreement before proceeding with the program.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">09/10/23, 19:09 - Angel EWYL23E0669:  I explained that however they told me they can't give out any details about the school unless I have that document which means that I would not be able to fill the form.</div></div>
