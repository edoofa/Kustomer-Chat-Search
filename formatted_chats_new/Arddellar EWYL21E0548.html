<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 20:49 - Unknown:  I see that you have selected 3 as the option, Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 21:27 - Arddellar EWYL21E0548:  From the article ,,i gathered up the issue of responsibility.

One has to make certain choices in life and this probably will shape your future.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 21:52 - Unknown:  Good to read your response on this lesson Arddellar!

We can also use the prioritising matrix to be able to arrange our tasks into categories.By using the priority matrix one has to ask himself questions like which of my tasks needs to be done in the next 48 hours</div></div>
