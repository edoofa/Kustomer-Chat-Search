<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 20:45 - Unknown:  AE isn't difficult, as such, it's just fiddly and time-consuming. Obviously you need to know what to do because you do it but there's not a whole lot more than 'applying effects, in a certain way, to certain frames or parts of a frame of a video'. Improving Motion Graphics (Cough cough, Youtube) However, After Effects opens many more doors for typography, visuals, and 3D animations that are leaps and bounds cooler than anything you can do in Premiere. Using After Effects for graphics alone is worth the time spent learning the software</div></div>
