I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

This  has been my most enjoyed project yet. I believe that the community has to grow in order to glow and speaking numbers, the more people to join Edoofa the greater its height. The pressure is now there on maintaining this standard of not only having Edoofa as a community with many people, but that with morals and beliefs that inspire nations at large.</div></div>
