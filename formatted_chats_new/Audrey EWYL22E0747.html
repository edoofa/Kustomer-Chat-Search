<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/23, 19:35 - Audrey EWYL22E0747:  \"Simplify\" is the first problem solving skill whereby one breaks down the problem into small sub sections where you focus on the cause,effect,result and solution for a problem.Numerical fluency this is when you focus on the numbers i.e of maybe the affected people or in shortage so as to apply a calculative solution that won't  fail again. The third problem solving strategy is the inverting notion. This allows one to think in reverse and get a solution on how to undo an already done damage and avoiding a problem.Studying the basics assists in the sense that one gets to identify the actual cause of a problem,how it could have been avoided ,how to rectify the mistake and ensure it does not recur in future.Lollapalooza Effects these come from long term causes and it's a contribution of many major factors and to fix it one needs to apply various big solutions however these effects take time to be dealt with completely.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/01/23, 16:40 - Audrey EWYL22E0747:  It was seen through research that asking lots of questions improves interpersonal bonding but it is a necessity that one asks good questions to get good answers.One must know their purpose  and be able to ask real questions which require informative answers this also shows the effort put in to genuinely know more about the next person. Asking good enjoyable questions requires one to be a good listener so as to know the right approach to use with the person in question. Dale Carnegie some eighty years ago advised people to be good listeners if they wish to get fully informed on the people around them and this still applies in the modern day. Wise interruption saves one from going on and on giving unnecessary information.One shouldn't fear asking wrong questions thus ask more to get more valid information. To get real answers and your interlocutor's true opnion you must not ask already concluded questions as they seem manipulative and only serve as a tool for getting the answers you want and not the next person's point of view. One's questions must be put in some sort of a hierachy whereby general ones are muffled up with some factual questions this assists in getting a smooth flowing easy conversations. In conclusion I can say for one to be able to ask good questions a person just has to ask more and put a good tone sand structuring to the questions.</div></div>
