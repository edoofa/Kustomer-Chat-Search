<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/10/22, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi:  Of course these must be lies Barnabas but before just declaring or stating that the person is telling lies, it is important that we clarify the concerns that this individual has as to what Edoofa is actually doing. The main issue is not posting something on the social media platform, the bigger concern is that we need to have a look at what the other person is thinking and what led him to think in that certain way.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/11/22, 21:39 - Saloni Rastogi:  I see you have typed two, this means you are unclear as to who a proud edoofian is and what it denotes.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/11/22, 21:40 - Saloni Rastogi:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/11/22, 21:40 - Saloni Rastogi:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
