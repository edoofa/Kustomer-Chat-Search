<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">30/05/23, 16:32 - Ananya:  It's completely normal to feel nervous when faced with an unprepared situation, like giving a speech. However, I want to remind you that preparation is key to boosting your confidence and delivering a successful performance. By dedicating time to rehearsing and practicing your speech beforehand, you can significantly reduce anxiety and improve your overall performance. Remember, every moment spent preparing is an investment in your success. So embrace the opportunity to prepare and watch your confidence soar as you conquer any challenge that comes your way.</div></div>
