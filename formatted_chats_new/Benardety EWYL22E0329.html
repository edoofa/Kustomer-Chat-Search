<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/08/22, 23:42 - Tenzin:  Hello Benardety, How are you? I am Mr Anshul.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/08/22, 01:38 - Benardety EWYL22E0329:  I am good sir how do do</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/08/22, 02:53 - Tenzin:  Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/08/22, 02:53 - Tenzin:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/08/22, 15:58 - Tenzin:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it.</div></div>
