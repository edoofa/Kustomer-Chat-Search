<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 23:32 - Saloni Rastogi:  I completely agree with you and I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/03/23, 22:02 - Saloni Rastogi:  To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt.

Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/03/23, 22:03 - Saloni Rastogi:  Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/03/23, 22:40 - Saloni Rastogi:  The thing is that in such cases when the school fee per term is less than $100, we do not take up the call but if the Principal gives us a heads up that the students can pay nearly $2000 for their students, we can have a call.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">06/03/23, 22:51 - Blessed EWYL22E0909:  But most local and day school pay less than $100 as there school fees</div></div>

In such a case, try to research more on such schools that as term fees more than $100 because we would not like to pressurize or emphasis the students on paying $2000 for their higher education.</div></div>
