<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 23:21 - Bradley EWYL22E0224:  -what i learned from the Wednesday lesson is that it is never too late to do something. I learned this because i was able to know that because Dami was challenged to change her organisation from a not-for profit to a profitable organisation in 5 days. She gladly accepted this and went straight down to work with her team, friends and mentors. I also learned that recently Skooqs has partnered with edoofian and this will ensure more benefits to students under edoofa and also employment opportunities. It is great to have an organisation such as skooqs as it helps children gain technological expertise in different fields.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 21:04 - Bradley EWYL22E0224:  -This week’s Wednesday’s wisdom talks about Patrice Motsipe, a successful black entrepreneur. It goes on to talk about how he went about to get where he is right now in life. We also learn that through learning, hard work, the right support, commitment and putting in the work, one can become anything they want to become in life. This story is also inspiring as it shows the lengths to which Patrice Motsipe had to go through to be where he is right now. From working in a spaza shop and being the son of a former teacher to making billions is some wild achievement. A lot of students can learn from Patrice Motsipe including myself also.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/07/22, 18:55 - Bradley EWYL22E0224:  -In response to my weekend activity, the fastest growing sector in my country has to be the export growth in horticulture. Horticulture is the fastest growing agricultural sector in the country and the second largest foreign exchange earner in the country after tobacco. During the 2020\/2021 season, the government allowed private sectors to fund agricultural activities which since then improved the transparency of the sector. The government has taken steps to promote cultivation of sorghum and millet which are more ecologically compatible with the country’s semi-arid areas. The country also has 4 130 000 hectares of arable land, 25 percent of which is cultivated using animal and manual draught power. One of the weaknesses of this sector even though it’s the fastest growing one in the country is that Following the government’s fast track land reform program which began in 2000, irrigation infrastructure deteriorated and the new majority holders of land depend on rain rather than irrigation for their crops. As the weather changes and the droughts become more frequent, the country has failed to produce enough grain to supply domestic demand. Opportunities in this sector are that of US companies. US companies can supply agricultural companies with high quality tractors to local farmers under the country’s high agricultural mechanisation drive. In addition, given frequent droughts, irrigation equipment, equipment that can improve water use efficiency and the introduction of drought resistance crops can help the sector especially small-scale commercial  farmers move away from rain fed agriculture.</div></div>

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 20:15 - Bradley EWYL22E0224:  -In response to my Saturday activity, I’m here to talk about the growth mindset of successful people and how i can develop the same mindset. Successful people with growth mindsets often realise that success is all about and the result of the right attitude and hard work. Successful people are often motivated and inspired by people who have been successful before and achieved great things. They also have a genuine appreciation for the accomplishments of others and they think about the factors that helped them breakthrough. Growth minded people are not afraid to challenge themselves, What they do is that they embrace them. In simple terms, we have to challenge ourselves in order for us to improve and be better. Successful people often see failure as an opportunity to grow. When people with growth mindsets fail, they don’t take it personally instead they learn from their mistakes and keep a positive attitude to come back stronger next time. Failure is never final unless one decides to give up. Persistence is the key to overcoming adversity and achieving goals.</div></div>

Time management does not only ensure that our tasks are done on time but also makes sure that everything in our lives is in order. As mentioned in the Wednesday wisdom passage, one can do everything productively and efficiently but still not get everything done in time, so this is where time managements comes in. As also mentioned that grouping tasks into urgent and important matters might be of use also. This should help set your priorities straight and help you get things done accordingly.</div></div>

I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/08/22, 17:41 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
