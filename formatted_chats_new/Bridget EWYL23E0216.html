<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/06/23, 19:03 - Bridget EWYL23E0216:  The key points I learned from the Wedneday Wisdom are that trust and honesty are an essential qualities of a leader and an individual as this can build trust and promote a culture of fairness.Another lesson is that we should not be discouraged by difficulties but use them as opportunities to grow and strive for more. True leadership requires one to make difficult decisions and the compassion to help others.As Edoofians we should embrace the ability to effect change regardless of out age and leave behind a mark in out various community.Mrs Sirleaf becoming the first female president in Africa pushes us to advocate for equal opportunities and end gender based discrimination as this could unlock countless opportunities for us.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/06/23, 17:43 - Bridget EWYL23E0216:  I assume it is because of the grant</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/06/23, 18:02 - Saloni Rastogi:  No, it is because you have not followed the daily ritual in the past two days. Can you share why is that?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/06/23, 18:03 - Bridget EWYL23E0216:  My sincereapologies,I thought I was only supposed to do that on days when I jave sessions.It will not happen again.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/06/23, 18:07 - Bridget EWYL23E0216:  Since we began the two sessions per week I had been doing so therefore since we had seemed not to have a problem I assumed that is how I am required to do it.It was not my intention.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/06/23, 18:08 - Saloni Rastogi:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/06/23, 18:08 - Saloni Rastogi:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
