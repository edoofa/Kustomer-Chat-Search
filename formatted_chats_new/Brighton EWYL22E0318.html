It comprises of a list of activities that need to be done in a day and it gives a highlight of your daily activities.One needs to find that time during the day when they are focused and active so that they can execute their tasks during that that time.Creating a network is also vital as you would be able to help people with their dreams and goals they inturn feel motivated to assist you achieve yours.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/07/22, 16:25 - Brighton EWYL22E0318:  the fast growing industry or business in Zimbabwe is the fruits and vegetable field.The fruits and vegetables market is expected to register a CAGR of 2.5% during a period of 2022 -2027.The industry was negatively affected by covid19 pandemic as the lockdown restricted farmers from transportation of goods leading to high spoilage of the produce.However during the pandemic the goverment realised the spoils and managed  to help farmers with trucks and building rooms which would help keep the produce fresh.this industry is always flactuating this is because of the inflations occuring in the country and changes in prices however the government decided to support the farmers and has been offering them seeds at affordable prices .The famers have very little exposure on the international market but through the gvernment's initiatives for adherence to phytosanitary conditions the export makert is boming for the produce.The demand for processed goods like juices and edible oils increased during the study period.In 2020 the fruits topped the Zimbabwe market production and accounting .Ever since 2017 there has been a steady increase in the production showing thee demand within the country and also outside countries like South Africa with 62% of imprts of fruits from Zim in 2017 and Vietman.there was a slight decline in 2020 due to the pandemic .Overally the vegetable market is dominant in Zimbabwe with  Matebeleland South being the main region for production</div></div>
