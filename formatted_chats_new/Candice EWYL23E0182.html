<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:22 - Candice EWYL23E0182:  Safely saying I have made it is really a relief to most of us but what does it really take to reach there. It takes up all the determination, the energy and the sweat left in you. The secret of getting ahead is getting started.The main aim is to never give up even if the road seems long. I never thought that I would be part of the wonderful community. I quote "Success is not final, failure is not fatal;it is the courage to continue that counts" Winston Churchill. The words kept on ringing in my mind that even if I give up no one is going to finish the race that I started or me. I was inspired by a lot of people that if they can make it therm so can I. Bit by bit we are all going to get there after all the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. Courage, faith and most of all hardwork can really get one where he/she wants to be.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:22 - Candice EWYL23E0182:  Project update: People are really adamant that they have already planned out where they are going to university</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:26 - Saloni Rastogi:  I appreciate your thoughtful reflection and the motivation it carries. It's true that reaching our goals requires determination, energy, and perseverance. The journey may be challenging, but it's important to remember that the key to progress is simply getting started. It's inspiring to see your commitment to never giving up, even when faced with obstacles. The quote from Winston Churchill serves as a powerful reminder that success is not about reaching a final destination or avoiding failure, but rather about having the courage to keep moving forward.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:26 - Saloni Rastogi:  I'm glad that my response resonated with you, and I'm here to support and provide motivation whenever you need it. Keep embracing courage, faith, and hard work, for they will guide you towards your desired destination. Remember, step by step, you will continue to progress and achieve your goals. Best of luck on your journey, and I'm confident that you will reach the heights you aspire to.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">06/07/23, 13:26 - Candice EWYL23E0182:  Continuously performing a certain task helps one to yield better results in such a way that one becomes better and better by that. Once one gets used to a task it serves as a motivation to continue pushing hard because you know you can do it and there is also progress in that as where there is progress there is success</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">17/07/23, 13:07 - Candice EWYL23E0182:  One of the many people I admire in my life is Mr Strive Masiyiwa who is a philanthropist and a renowned business man.He is an inspiration to many and he has many achievements throughout his life and career. Mr Masiyiwa started his own electrical engineering company and soon he wanted to diversify into telecoms.He then faced problems with the government which did not want to give him a license to operate his business. Above all, he did not give up on his dream. After a five year old battle all ruled in his favour and he pursued his dream. In 2015, he was given named in the 10 most powerful men in Africa and the International Refugee Commitee(IRC) awarded him the Freedom Award which isannually given to an individual for an extraordinary contribution towards refugees and championing the causes of liberty, individual freedom and dignity. Mr Masiyiwa inspires me because he never gave up on his dreams and he continued pushing. I quote"Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time"Thomas Edison. Mr Masiyiwa's successes have always pushed me on because success doesn't just come at the moment but it takes time, patience, determination and hardwork.</div></div>

His determination and resilience are indeed inspiring and serve as a reminder that success often requires persistence and hard work. Mr. Masiyiwa's journey exemplifies the importance of never giving up on our dreams, even in the face of challenges or setbacks.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/07/23, 13:41 - Saloni Rastogi:  Your recognition of his achievements and the lessons you draw from his story show that you are motivated to pursue your own goals with the same level of dedication and perseverance.
