It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

From my understanding you have to simplify situations by attacking the big problems first and then simplify them. The other part of problem solving is having Numerical fluency , this part pf life you have to be well versed with the scientific staff in order to change into the practical life of it and according to charlie without Numerical fluency you are like a one legged man.the Third Strategy is that you have to invert , Inverting will not necessarily mean that you can solve the problem but helps you not to get into the trouble and Charlie called it the the problem filter which i found funny and intresting?.the other thing is that you have to study the basics , understanding the basics is something that keeps on coming up and moreover to me it was the best problem solving strategy i liked.</div></div>
