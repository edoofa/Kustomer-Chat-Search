Are we going to be having our sessions from 09:30 to 10:30 every day or just on Tuesdays and Fridays? Also, with our previous session, we couldn't meet up as you were held up in a meeting and by the time you became available,our time was up and thus,I was already back at work; I therefore was unsure of whether or not to still answer the questions for the lessons as I only became available after 4pm...does that then count as a penalty on my part?</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">30/01/23, 00:02 - Saloni Rastogi:  Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
