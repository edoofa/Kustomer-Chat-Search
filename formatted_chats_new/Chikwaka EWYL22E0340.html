<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">09/08/22, 22:51 - Saloni Rastogi:  One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard.</div></div>

How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.</div></div>

Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group.
