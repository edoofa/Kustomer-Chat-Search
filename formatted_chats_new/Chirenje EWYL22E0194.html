I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us.

It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

He says the one thing he wishes he had known sooner was, ‘sometimes when an idea is still at birth, not many will see it the way you do but you have to believe in it yourself. He also highlights that the best business decision you can ever make is hiring the right people.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/08/22, 18:41 - Unknown:  I see you have typed two, may I know what confusion are you facing as to who and what a proud edoofian denotes?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/08/22, 18:41 - Unknown:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/08/22, 18:41 - Unknown:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/08/22, 18:45 - Unknown:  I know we have both been connected in the EWYL Journey for a long time now and I very well know how dedicatedly and consistently you work and make every session's discussion very productive and interactive.</div></div>
