<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/02/23, 00:44 - Jasmine Kaur:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">08/02/23, 02:06 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018:  Good evening, I apologize for not connecting with you at the suggested time slot. But I assume you were unable to connect too as you didn't communicate?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/02/23, 19:29 - Jasmine Kaur:  Greetings my proud edoofian,</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/02/23, 19:30 - Jasmine Kaur:  Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"</div></div>

I did that and shared information about them with Me.Riva.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/02/23, 19:35 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018:  The second project required me to share information about the Edoofa program with my friends. I managed to do that and got three people who were interested to fill out an application form and I shared them with Ms.Riva who shared them with the board.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/02/23, 19:37 - Choolwe EWYL22E1018:  For my third project I was supposed to share information about the Edoofa program with schools in my country and connect them to it but I unfortunately haven't gotten any response from the schools I reached out to.</div></div>
