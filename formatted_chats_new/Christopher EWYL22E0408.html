<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/10/22, 19:06 - Unknown:  Edoofian, this is to inform you that we will have a discussion around your projects tomorrow. Last week I gave you a task in which you had to submit 1 school , 1 company and 5 community building forms. I hope it is completed by now, hence I would need updates today.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/10/22, 19:06 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
