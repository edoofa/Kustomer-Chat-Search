<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/08/22, 22:33 - Saloni Rastogi:  One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard.</div></div>
