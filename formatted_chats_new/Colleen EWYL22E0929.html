<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">23/03/23, 22:58 - Colleen EWYL22E0929:  I understood that there's been a debate about the advantages and disadvantages of wealth in the society, statistics as mentioned in the pdf has proven that wealth is surrounded more by misconceptions that come with it to the general society  .The problems that have come as a result of wealth include land degradation,fraud,exploitation of people and corruption and this is not ethical to the society as it comes from worsening other things or people.However,wealth is not only a bad tool to the society as it comes with making living standards of people better than they were before and make the world a better place</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">23/03/23, 23:24 - Aditi Kapoor:  Yes, you are correct that there has been an ongoing debate about the advantages and disadvantages of wealth in society. While wealth can bring about benefits such as increased economic growth, higher standards of living, and job creation, it can also contribute to negative consequences like land degradation, fraud, exploitation, and corruption.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">23/03/23, 23:26 - Aditi Kapoor:  Ultimately, it is up to individuals and businesses to use their wealth in a responsible and ethical manner to ensure that the benefits of wealth are shared by all members of society, rather than just a privileged few.</div></div>
