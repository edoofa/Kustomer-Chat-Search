Inorder for a student to participate in the projects one should communicate with other students in many schools ,they should be as many as possible.Also ,for a student to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits one should have confidence in whatever tasks you are given and required to do.Time management is also required for a student to earn as many scholarship credits as possible.Moreover for a student to be given a chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits,we should practice on how to communicate with our mentors.They will give useful information on how to work on projects and earn more scholarship credits.</div></div>
