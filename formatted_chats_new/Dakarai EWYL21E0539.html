<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">28/07/22, 23:33 - Unknown:  Time management is defined as using your time productively and efficiently—but what about when you are working as productively as possible, and you still can’t get everything done? It may be better to think about time management as a combination of working productively and prioritizing your time.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/07/22, 00:57 - Dakarai EWYL21E0539:  I have learnt that time management is the combination of utilising our productively and effectively. Our tasks are divided into those that are important and those that are urgent. Important tasks are those that matter and failure to do them has consequences and urgent tasks are those that demand attention but don't have consequences if they are not carried out. The Priority Matrix helps us to know which tasks to do first in their order of priority. We have to do</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/08/22, 00:24 - Unknown:  A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.</div></div>
