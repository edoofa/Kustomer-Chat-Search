I see that he started small but later he was the biggest thing. All this was possible due to his Hard work and hunger for success. He is someone who saw profit when others saw loss.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/07/22, 23:39 - David EWYL22E0043:  The fastest growing sector in Zimbabwe is the mining sector. Zimbabwe is rich in many minerals i.e. gold, diamond, tin, copper, platinum and other metallic and nonmetallic ores. The mining sector also contributes about 16% of GDP.  Mining industry has high values and bestowed with significant mineral resources available on the earth to go for. However, its overbearingly negative environmental impacts outweigh the socioeconomic benefits. Air pollution, water pollution and land degradation are common in areas where such mining is carried out. Mined materials are needed to construct roads and hospitals, to build automobiles and houses, to make computers and satellites, to generate electricity, and to provide the many other goods and services that consumers enjoy. In addition, mining is economically important to producing regions and countries. In a world of deeper mines, more complex ore bodies, rising energy costs, social and geopolitical risks, infrastructure shortages and resource nationalism, mining companies remain under exceptional pressure to control costs, heighten efficiency and improve safety performance.</div></div>
