He also manage to conquer his fears and had faith in what he did. More to that his hard work helped him develop his idea. The best thing about Peters is when he had developed  his idea,he focused on that one idea till it became successful  before focusing on the other which is something  that many people fail to do whereby they want to carry out many projects at once. Moreover he also got the strength to keep developing his idea from people who supported his vision as well as the prayers he made.</div></div>
