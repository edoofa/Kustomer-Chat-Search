<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 18:06 - Unknown:  Hello my proud Edoofians hope you are doing well. \u2028\u2028You must have learned how critical it is to take advantage of every opportunity. In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!! Thanks to Oluwadamilola Soyombo's (Founder of Skooqs), diligence and use of the opportunity. The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 18:06 - Unknown:  Also, I have an exciting video for you to go through, I sure was overwhelmed to see the love all of you shared. As I shared that the founders of the Edoofa program Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen were traveling across Africa the whole of last month, I have some exciting highlights to share with you from the same. So, please watch the following video of the same and we will discuss it in our next session.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:17 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
