<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/07/23, 00:13 - Desire EWYL22E0689:  Consistency is a critical driver for success. Being consistent means dedicating yourself to goals and activities to achieve them. Growing up, my brother made sure he took an hour to two hours, twice a day studying and doing school work. He was really consistent with his actions from form 3 to form 6. I asked him one day what he wanted to do when he grows up and he said he want to be a software engineer. He was really consistent with his studying actions and this made him to perform wonders in his academics. When he passed his junior secondary school level, it was now like a challenge to me to break the record of results set by my brother. When he wrote his senior secondary school exam and got 13 points, I was really delighted but on the other hand i knew my brother had gave me a challenge. One day i realized one thing, my brother wasn't only working hard at school for himself but he was also leading by example to us, his fellow siblings. From that day i had to work up early studying with him. Most of my nearby friends ended up joining us in the afternoon at weekends when we were studying. As far as books are consened my mother always new that my brother always takes care of us.</div></div>
