<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/11/23, 12:59 - Ecclesiastic EWYL23E0459:  I come from a poor family. In 2018 my mother got employed at Alheit High School . She got that chance because of her level of education. In 2019 my mother took me to continue my education at Alheit. As my family was poor sometimes I used to feel out of place due to level of wealthy. My ordinary level for me was so difficult as l was without any friend to share my ideas and problems.l worked extra hard to achieve something and at the end l passed my ordinary level.  After ordinary level ,my parents failed to find me school fres to continue with my education .However the RCZ  synod committee  give me the chance to continue with my education by paying me three quarters of my school fees which reduce labour to my parents. My  wish since I was young was to do something which will improve the standard of living of my family. Now l have finished my Advanced Level ,the only thing which is left is to fulfill my dreams to be one of prestigious professionals in my society. Because of my every day living sometimes gives me extra power to work hard so that my family can also be counted in my society. The challenge which is still bothering me is the lack of money  so that l can talk to you everytime I am supposed to do so. Sometimes I also failed to talk to people because they will be laughing at me due to different levels of living. The only thing which makes me happy every single day is that my brothers and my sister are thriving very hard to help me fulfill my dreams.</div></div>
