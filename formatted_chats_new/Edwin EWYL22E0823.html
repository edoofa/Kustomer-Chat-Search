<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/02/23, 21:05 - Jasmine Kaur:  Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/02/23, 21:06 - Edwin EWYL22E0823:  That a leader shouldn't command or force things on to the people his leading bi instead should work with his people and guide them</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/02/23, 20:35 - Edwin EWYL22E0823:  It was during the inter District Junior Engineers Technicians and scientists fair. We, as a school, had little to no participants and the leaders were uninterested in the fair. So me and 2 friends of mine took it upon ourselves to collect and convince people to join the club. We gathered the individuals according to their skills and interests from all grades in the school. And by the end of it we had over 57 participants, which was more than enough to fit all categories of the competition. That activity gave me a clearer sense of passion of what I want to do with my life and what I am capable to do if I just put my mind in the position to do it.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 21:27 - Jasmine Kaur:  To achieve this goal, we will be working on both Project 2, the Community Building project, and Project 3, the African School Reform mission project, throughout this month.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 21:48 - Edwin EWYL22E0823:  I would go to the school and would be directed to the school secretary. There I would ask for a time for which I could see the head concerning the Edoofa program. Most of the time they say that they would get back to me on the appropriate time to see the head and they would take down my information. They wouldn't respond and when I go back to the school they would tell me that they didn't find time for me.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 21:51 - Edwin EWYL22E0823:  And for the community building project, most if not all of the people I know already have their own program by now so the only people that would be willing to join the Edoofa program are in their final year (in boarding school )</div></div>
