<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:21 - Elina EWYL22E1197:  They are going just fine</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:28 - Ananya:  Now, Elina! I was just discussing productivity and the importance of seriousness in day-to-day life with a few of my students. Some of them expressed concerns about a decline in their performance and expressed a desire to address this issue. Hence, I thought about asking each student about their individual weaknesses and working together to overcome them. You see, I firmly believe that striving for perfection is both impossible and unnecessary. However, in order to make progress in life and stand out from the crowd, it's important to continuously strive to become a better version of ourselves. So, I wanted to inquire if you have ever encountered a situation where you identified a personal weak point and felt the need to rectify it.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:30 - Elina EWYL22E1197:  My personal weak point is failure to understand in groups I personally find group work tricky because my concentration is less</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:34 - Ananya:  Well, Understanding and working well in groups can be hard for some people. To get better at it, here are a few things you can do:</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:34 - Ananya:  - Ask for help: If you're having trouble understanding something in the group work, don't hesitate to ask your peers for help or clarification. Group work is about learning together, so take advantage of the knowledge and skills of your group members.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:40 - Elina EWYL22E1197:  Thank you</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:49 - Ananya:  Now, may I know if you were able to find schools?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:58 - Elina EWYL22E1197:  Yes I found a school but the head teacher asked me to write a letter to the district education board proposing the introduction of edoofa programme to that very school then after that I should get back to him so that I can do a PowerPoint presentation at the school</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:58 - Elina EWYL22E1197:  I am working on the letter at the moment</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 18:59 - Elina EWYL22E1197:  And I also searched up some companies so when do I have to send their details</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 19:00 - Ananya:  You can share the details in our next session. Now, let's conclude our session here. We will reconnect during our next session on Friday. In the meantime, please make sure to read our weekly newsletter so that we can discuss its contents in our upcoming session.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/06/23, 18:11 - Elina EWYL22E1197:  I understood that failure is an inevitable part of life, usually society glorifies success and stigmatizes failure....failure helps us confront our weaknesses, acknowledge our limitations and work on improving ourselves...failure is an important part of life because it leads to success and most successful people that have existed once underwent failure</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/06/23, 18:21 - Ananya:  Failure indeed serves as a valuable teacher, allowing us to understand what doesn't work and guiding us towards more effective approaches in the future. It requires us to confront our weaknesses, acknowledge our limitations, and work on self-improvement.</div></div>
