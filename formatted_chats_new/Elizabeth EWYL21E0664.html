<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 22:21 - Elizabeth EWYL21E0664:  I was indeed inspired by the story of Patrice Tilhopane Motsepe who was born with no money but he had goals. A hardworker , passion , believed in himself and never gave up. He got exposure to business by helping his father in a Spaza shop where her would sell liquor to miners before they would go to work. His story to become a billionaire has taught me many things by starting small he had to learn business from the start , this taught me to always be aware of surroundings so as to not let great opportunities pass by when all you need is to learn . It also taught me that one can start small and and up being successful all that is needed is to be hardworking, believing in yourself , passion and never giving up . When there is an opportunity one should grab it and use it in the right way . Therefore this can lead a person to success.</div></div>

It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance.
