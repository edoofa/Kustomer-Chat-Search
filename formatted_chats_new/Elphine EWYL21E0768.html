<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 22:38 - Unknown:  Elphine, I am sure that you must have recognized the plethora of possibilities for skill growth that students can experience if they work on real-world projects for businesses. A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.</div></div>
