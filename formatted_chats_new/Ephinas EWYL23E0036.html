<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">01/05/23, 16:44 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036:  And then the other one where I have to form a group and add students is tricky because most of the students are still in school and haven't yet graduated and I  don't know if you are aware that now most schools in zambia have free education, and there are only few schools that require students to pay which makes it difficult even when a student enrolls as an Edoofa student to pay the first part of the fee. I don't know if you understand my concerns</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">01/05/23, 16:47 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036:  No bot yet and I'm having challenges on the procedure on how to get the forms</div></div>

You have to talk to them and tell them the benefits. Every message is shared with you on the WhatsApp group and then you have to tell the student to fill the form.</div></div>

Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/05/23, 13:57 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036:  Good morning, today I'm sharing with you what I learned from our Edoofa founders who came to visit us in zambia. I firstly would like to appreciate their visitation, I learned alot from them. After reading this Wednesday wisdom document I have have noticed that our leaders the founder of Edoofa, have all the characteristics of a good leader needed by the community.  Firstly I noticed that they are good listeners because they gave a chance to parents and students to ask questions. And I was very happy to see that they had addressed the questions very well to the satisfaction of the parents and us students.  As a proud edoofian who we'll be a leader in future, its very important to adopt this characteristic of being a good leader. Secondly, I learned that our great leaders (founders of Edoofa) are servant leaders.  They focus on serving people and sharing their leadership power so that the community can grow. This inspires me to be a servant leader too so that I can serve people and not just focus on thriving the organization but also being passionate in making a difference in people's lives. I would like to share with you the short experience I've had since the time I joined this community.  So far it has taught me to be hardworking and especially being punctuation for sessions, weather with the counselor or my mentor. And this is really a positive change in my life. Apart from that I also learned that our leaders the founders of Edoofa Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen Singh have effortless commitment to making this community grow so that many live lives can be helped.  They have done this by visiting different nations to Educate and help them understand about the importance of hard work and higher education. They have a sense of building  community building. In conclusion I  wish for this community to keep growing and I am a proud edoofian.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">24/05/23, 15:08 - Ephinas EWYL23E0036:  So this question is talking about leadership and how we can become leaders through the EWYL projects that were given to us by our mentors. So through this program and the projects that wr have been given, they can help us to be good leaders by executing them. As a leader you have to think critically on how you can execute a plan, this also applies to the projects that were have been given, we have to try by all means and make sure that by the end of the day the projects are executed.  The other thing that can help us be good leaders through the projects is a good communication skills.  During the EWYL program our mentors advise us to be have good communication, by good communication I mean we should learn how to communicate to different groups of people.  And good communication is one of the most important skills a good leader has to attain.  The other thing that can help is to be good leaders through the EWYL projects is through perseverance. We might face some challenges in executing the projects but as a leader you have to perseve and not to give up. The other thing that can help us to be good leaders through the EWYL projects is commitment.  As a good leader you have to be committed to the task that you are assigned to do.</div></div>
