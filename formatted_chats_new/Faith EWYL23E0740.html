<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 15:46 - Faith EWYL23E0740:  Yes but I have never did one before</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 15:51 - Ananya:  You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 15:53 - Faith EWYL23E0740:  Ok I understand.so does this resume have a format on how to write it</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 15:54 - Ananya:  Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 16:01 - Faith EWYL23E0740:  Interesting</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 16:04 - Ananya:  Alright! Now, please watch this video and create a resume by our next session. As of now, let us now discuss your EWYL project. Now moving ahead I want to discuss something significant with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 16:08 - Faith EWYL23E0740:  Ok I understand</div></div>
