There is also problem solving, as a student l may face different problems which will need me to solve ,so l need to have that confident to overcome obstacles. As students we need to be good at teamwork ,helping each other with different ideas to overcome challenges. I need to ask my mentors everything l can't understand in my EWYL session so as to earn more credits.More so ,l need to take my time and participate in each and every lesson given by my mentor.Being trustworthy and having good behaviour might led me to be able  to do my projects very well.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 19:39 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">23/07/22, 01:23 - Unknown:  Good to read your response on this lesson Edoofian! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
