<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:54 - Fanwell EWYL22E0900:  alright, mem, As my understanding on Wednesday lesson,its all about  underrated and underappreciated skills in a work place,especially to us young professionals in our career.Thus call self awareness that skill is recognised by WHO  world Health organisation.And they give us an example of the person who has that  personal awareness like  Mr Barack Obama who has valuing time by deviate the schedule</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:55 - Ananya:  I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:58 - Fanwell EWYL22E0900:  Quiet great,also agree with you Mem</div></div>
