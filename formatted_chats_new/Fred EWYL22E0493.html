<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/01/23, 00:01 - Fred EWYL22E0493:  On last weeks Wednesday wisdom. It focused on principles of persuasion. I learnt that reducing the availability of a product on the market can be used to lure many people to wanting it. Creating a sense of scarcity may be a way to persuade people into making a certain decision. The secondly, doing the unexpected eg buying someone a birthday present. This means that you have persuaded them into buying you also a gift the time when your birthday comes next time. So doing a favour to people will force them to do you also a favour thus they have been persuaded. If you want to influence and persuade people, first they need to like you. Building relationships with the people you want to influence is an important key. You need to gain their trust by giving them good genuine compliments, cooperation with them nicely. This you can be able to influence them. When humans make decisions, they usually consider what others are doing, that's what helps them make decisions sometimes. It's much more easier to influence the person who trusts you     than those that don't.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/01/23, 23:26 - Fred EWYL22E0493:  First and foremost, you need to simplify problems by using no brainer questions. Some problems are not easily solved the way they look, so we must think and attempt them differently maybe by inverting them. Thinking in reverse may be very helpful. Big things are brought by a combination of large factors. You need to combine a lot of things to combine one big output which means sometimes you have to work outside of your working hours to solve problems. Think in a multidisciplinary manner.</div></div>
