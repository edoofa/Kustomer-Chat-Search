Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group.

We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
