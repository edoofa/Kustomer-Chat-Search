<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 21:02 - Aditi Kapoor:  Gamuchirai, first let me help you understand what an edoofian is. An edoofian is a strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 21:43 - Gamuchirai EWYL22E0185:  I learnt that losers play the blame game but winners take responsibility of their mistakes.The story l read highlights that it is easy to blame people for our failures rather than taking responsibility , learning from the mistakes and finding solutions to the problem for the better benefit of the future.All we have to do is remain determined because our attitude towards situations plays a big role in our daily lives.Our attitude towards situations affects our perspective of things in life ,be it positively and negatively.l also learnt to ask further before giving a final judgement because if the sailer hadn't blamed the sea but breather asked first she wouldn't have been humiliated.Attituse either strengthens or destroys friendships or interaction with people</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 21:54 - Aditi Kapoor:  Good to read your response on this lesson Gamuchirai! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it.</div></div>
