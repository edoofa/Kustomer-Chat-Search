<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">28/10/22, 21:49 - Gelean EWYL22E0061:  I enjoyed community build the most</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">28/10/22, 21:55 - Aditi Kapoor:  Great to hear that Gelean! But community building should not just be a project for us, but also a way of life, because, at the end of the day, that is our goal right, to give back to the community and help everyone grow to their full potential. So, I want you to keep working on the community building project and be a testimony of how every other student in your school or in your area, can also fulfill their dream of better education, or foreign education, and work towards a better future.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">28/10/22, 21:56 - Aditi Kapoor:  Apart from that I want you to take some time out of your schedule and work on the other 2 projects as well, where you research about companies and schools, and can help in connecting us with them.</div></div>
