We all need to have a diverse skill set because the world is changing and you might end up using those skills that you would have picked up for a living. We should apply the skills that we learn in our day to day lives so as to become professional entrepreneurs one day. The book covers 7 main ideas and all of them give the main idea of continuous improvement, being open minded as well as being keen to learn from mentors and professionals.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/06/23, 16:15 - Grace EWYL23E0201:  It takes a community to be able to render a project or task successful in the end. I only truly believed this after joining the Edoofa team and becoming part of a family whose aim is to support and build one another. Because I've experienced the positive impacts of becoming a proud Edoofian, I saw it fit to let my peers know about this once in a lifetime chance to become better and greater people in the future. Helping each other with knowledge and research will help to gather together important information that will be useful in our future careers and so as to share with other people as well who might not be able to get such an opprtunity. I've managed to get some friends to see how wonderful this program and they have taken action to also becoming part of the family. It is very essential for one to never forget where they came from and what made them into the success that they are. That is why I am in the processing of fully engaging my school and letting them know about this profound program so that my juniors will have more light on how their futures will be so bright after enrolling with Edoofa. This will help me to become more patient and persuasive hence improving my marketing and networking skills.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/06/23, 17:11 - Grace EWYL23E0201:  Our circumstances should not determine what our future will be like. Instead, they should serve as a source of motivation and direction for where we want to be in the future. We should aim to be the strength of those around us and our fellow Edoofians when they are faced with hard times. It is also important for us as Edoofians and leaders of tomorrow to be able to be truthful at all times as it makes life easier for everyone. Just as Ellen Sirleaf managed to rise above the issues to do with gender inequality, we should also strive to do the same and lift each other up. Youth empowerment through education is very vital and we should take the Edoofa program seriously as it will be transformative for our lives. United we stand and as Edoofians we should be willing to work together as one so as to succeed.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/06/23, 17:33 - Grace EWYL23E0201:  My entrepreneur of choice is Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa. She was born into a family that had what it took to live life to the fullest being able to afford a good lifestyle which is something kind of different from my life story. Regardless of being the daughter of a renowned physician and politician, she still had the zeal to make a life of her own and to live not according to what people thought she would do but according to what she wanted for herself which was so inspiring. From being a broadcastor on the country's tv and radio stations, she has also become one of the things I aspire to be which is a philanthropist. The youth are indeed the leaders of tomorrow and the guidance that she gives to them is amazing and something that is in my pipeline for the future. She didn't take comfort in the priviledges that she grew up with but managed to see beyond that and still wanted something to her name which i really admire about her. Ruvheneko has a taste for politics and wanting to know everything from the horse's mouth which is one dissimilarity between us but this symbolises so much boldness and courage indeed!</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">24/06/23, 19:53 - Grace EWYL23E0201:  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was a force to reckon with as she was driven by integrity which is something so admirable about her. It is so rare to find someone who is upfront about being against corruption and who actually works towards it. Before even getting to the higher levels of corruption, integrity is about treating those who are around you including your fellow edoofians in the same way despite  who they are, what they have or do not have. This really is a lesson for me to be fair towards everyone because this can form trust which can help assisting each other school wise as well as becoming trustworthy employees to our future employers. Secondly, she managed to break gender barriers which was much needed in a world where men were deemed to be deserving of certain opportunities like leading a country. This has helped me to believe in myself as the girl child and to affirm myself that I'm capable of doing anything that I can put my mind to. Ellen has served as motivation to target those large companies and be the one with the highest position because why not? For this to become true for me as well, I will have to read widely on other females who have made it to the top and learn from them. I would need to be consistent in cultivating those habits until they become a lifestyle which means success will be just a step away!</div></div>
