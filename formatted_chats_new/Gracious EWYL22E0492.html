Ready??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.</div></div>

Members of a group of friends , family or coworkers draw random names to become someone's Secret santa.With secret santa,you actually get to go out and shop for the person whose name you picked . Since you know who's going to get your gift,you can buy something with them in mind. It's a personal gift -giving experience for both of us .This Christmas holiday I'm going to be my twin sister  Gorden Gachata's secret santa . I'm going to give her a colorful Airpod case, novelty socks and skincare sets.my sister has a mania for music that's why I'm planning to buy her a pair of colorful Airpods.Also she is asthetician ,simply simple she can't live without skincare products ,she always makes time for her skin no matter what that's why l have chosen her skincare set as a gift .lastly this is a rainy season that's why l have chosen her novelty socks because in rainy season she always stays indoors because she is allergic to rain ,so when she is at home she is always with her socks on that's why l have chosen her comfortable novelty socks.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/01/23, 18:52 - Saloni Rastogi:  Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
