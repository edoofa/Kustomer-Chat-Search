<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">17/03/23, 22:04 - Hester EWYL22E1303:  Thank you so much for the opportunity .Firstly People in the today's society seek money and wealth so that they can be recognized by the society but this can end up leading to stress ,anxiety and even depression .Wealth is defined as an asset that can earn while you sleep .This means that the value of your assets continues to grow and multiply even when you are not working or earning.Furthermore one a should create assets that generate income that is passive .For instance the income should support the family and the next generation .Lastly money is a tool  we use to transfer time and wealth .This means money is a medium for exchange .</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">17/03/23, 22:30 - Hester EWYL22E1303:  Okay thank you</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/03/23, 22:34 - Saloni Rastogi:  You have concluded the understanding of the lesson so well. Even my learning has been that 'Money is simply a tool that we use to transfer time and wealth, and that status is not a measure of true success or happiness. Instead, focus on building wealth and creating a life that brings you joy and fulfillment.'</div></div>

Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!</div></div>

Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school.

Coupled with the Earn While you Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he\/she has got more opportunities to chase him\/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development\/growth.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/03/23, 23:12 - Saloni Rastogi:  Now, It is time to explain with examples How Edoofa is revolutionizing the Education System on the African Continent. Examples create clarity. This is why they are used in all contexts as a tool to provide further understanding. When it comes to your conversation, examples play a significant role in your ability to effectively communicate the elements that you want the School Head to understand.</div></div>
