<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/05/23, 15:39 - Hove EWYL23E0076:  With my understanding of these principles I got that they are interlinked so as to bring out the best in a person and also to give one a successful future.These principles also teach one how to conduct themselves and command destiny.They show that one has to plan about the future and be certain enough to achieve the goals. They help one to stay focused on their goals and dreams for example the principle of Desire shows us that one has define or decide their goal about the future then put maximum effort to it.Also teach one to be patient and never to take failure as an option for example the principle of Faith which states that the negativity in people can be changed to positive if we as people have belief and stay focused on our dreams and goals.Through the state of imagination one can draw a future and also plan ahead. These ideas will be brought to ground and worked on to bring out the best of success in a person.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/05/23, 15:39 - Hove EWYL23E0076:  The one I found easiest to understand and apply is the principle of desire this principle I found it easy as it is the key success by this one has to first take note of what they want to achieve in the  future then they try by all means to put all effort into achieving it.For example if one wants to be a successful they lawyer during their high school life they are the ones who are mostly expected to be participative in debates and discussions as this will help in improving their confidence ,critical thinking skills and also proper communication skills.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor:  Hello Hove</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor:  Your understanding of the interdependence of these principles is insightful and accurate. Indeed, these principles work together to help individuals achieve their goals and attain success.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor:  The principles of Desire and Faith, for example, emphasize the importance of having a clear goal and a strong belief in oneself and one's abilities. These principles can help individuals stay focused and motivated in the face of challenges or setbacks. Similarly, the principle of Imagination encourages individuals to visualize and plan for their future, helping them to identify opportunities and make informed decisions.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor:  The principle of Planning also plays a crucial role in achieving success. By taking the time to carefully consider their goals and the steps needed to achieve them, individuals can increase their chances of success. Group discussions and collaboration can also be valuable tools in the planning process, as they allow individuals to share ideas and perspectives and identify potential obstacles or opportunities.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/05/23, 16:42 - Aditi Kapoor:  It is important to note, however, that failure is often a natural and necessary part of the journey towards success. The principles you mentioned, such as Faith and Patience, can help individuals stay resilient and focused even in the face of setbacks. By remaining committed to their goals and persevering through challenges, individuals can ultimately achieve the success they desire.</div></div>
