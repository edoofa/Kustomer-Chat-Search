It can help you to challenge risky assumptions and to uncover dangerous blindspots about your organization's performance.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 22:14 - Tenzin:  For example, you may be well aware of some of your organization's strengths, but until you record them alongside weaknesses and threats you might not realize how unreliable those strengths actually are.</div></div>

I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake.
