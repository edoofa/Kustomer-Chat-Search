<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/01/23, 04:03 - Unknown:  The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them. For example: it’s raining and you need to go to the store. What do you do? There are lots of possible solutions. Take your umbrella and walk. If you don't want to get wet, you can drive, or take the bus. There is no right way to solve this problem and different people will solve it differently. However in our Wednesday wisdom we learnt about some Problem solving strategies. As part of your Saturday activity, I want you to share with us a problem that you encountered very recently and how did you Solve It. Did you use any strategy that was similar to what Munger has talked about?</div></div>
