And you know what, the way you want to earn scholarship credits and help yourself financially, I am working 10 times more than everyone so that all my students avail the best out of this opportunity. But I feel more saddened for the fact that each time I have to make you realize to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', this is something which should be done by you without any reminders.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/11/22, 02:53 - Jasmine Kaur:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying ‚ÄúI am a Proud Edoofian‚Äù daily.</div></div>
