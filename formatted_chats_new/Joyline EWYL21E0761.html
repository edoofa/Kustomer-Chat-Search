I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/08/22, 20:48 - Unknown:  Joyline, Did you read the super interesting story of 19 year old Gilbert Eugene Peters from Zimbabwe that I shared with you yesterday?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/08/22, 21:00 - Joyline EWYL21E0761:  Yes sir l did ...and l learnt that l should believe in mysef and dismiss the negativity of people's opinions inorder to my dreams come to reality</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/08/22, 22:20 - Unknown:  Good to read your understanding of the lesson Joyline. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it... yet.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/08/22, 01:51 - Joyline EWYL21E0761:  I understand sir</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/08/22, 02:07 - Unknown:  You see Joyline, a lack of consistency keeps ordinary people from achieving extraordinary results. Excelling at the small choices that compound over time perpetually leaves you in favorable circumstances. No matter what happens in the world, you’re never in a position where you are forced into a bad decision.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/08/22, 19:51 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
