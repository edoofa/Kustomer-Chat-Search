<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 19:17 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 04:54 - Unknown:  I am doing good Judith, thanks for asking.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 04:55 - Unknown:  You typed three, may I know what challenges are you facing as to who a proud edoofian is?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 04:56 - Unknown:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 16:03 - Judith EWYL21E0623:  It's not like I'm facing challenges but I love learning typing number 1 would limit me from getting the full knowledge</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 19:26 - Unknown:  Greetings Judith!</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 19:28 - Unknown:  Oh, I see that Judith. But I want to say that it would be best if you can express what you actually feel, since you are very well aware of who a proud edoofian is, it is better that you type 1 for such a case.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 20:20 - Judith EWYL21E0623:  Noted</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/07/22, 03:19 - Unknown:  Great to see your understanding of being a proud EDOOFIAN.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
