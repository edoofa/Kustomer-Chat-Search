<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 03:30 - Saloni Rastogi:  The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
