<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">07/10/22, 21:50 - Keith EWYL22E0323:  I understood that, the only way to grow is to reflect on what are you good at and what has to be improved. One has to be prioritisation. Have a vision in life for a bigger picture, creation of a master list of what you need to be done. Find the productive cycle and utilize them. Believe and helping others on their vision.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">07/10/22, 21:51 - Keith EWYL22E0323:  On the other hand, the plan to connect with the headmaster is a failure if I may say because there is no progress and I think he blocked me. I was was suggesting if we can try another project</div></div>

I also took note that even if some people look down upon your vision keep yourself determined and make them beleive in you as time move.</div></div>
