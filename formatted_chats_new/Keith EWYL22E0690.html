<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/11/22, 23:46 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 01:16 - Unknown:  I understand Keith! The weather keeps changing here, I would suggest you to stay warm, and put on your winter clothes, as it can get chilly at night.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 17:47 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Yes</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 17:59 - Unknown:  So Keith! Did you go through the Wednesday lesson?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 18:01 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Yes i did</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 18:45 - Unknown:  can you please share your understanding and learning of the same with me?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 18:48 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  It's about not having only a mindset of a winner but also how to be a winner, it explains how native Africans who came to India for slave labour rose to power in the Indian govt and brought about change in their community</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 18:50 - Unknown:  That's some great understanding Keith! Now, what did you learn from this lesson, that you are thinking of applying in your life?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 18:52 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  That if you are dedicated about something in life and you do not quit no matter how difficult or how many challenges arise you will certainly make it in that perspective</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 19:00 - Unknown:  I am really impressed with your clear understanding Keith! I can be sure of the fact that if you keep up this habit of keen observation and crystal clarity, we can go a long way in the program.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 19:04 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Thank you sir</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 19:23 - Unknown:  Great! So Keith, are you ready to start working on the projects?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 19:29 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Yes i am sir</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 19:35 - Unknown:  Great! So, I want you to set a target for your own self relating to the projects, which you try to achieve in the week.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 19:45 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Can you explain more</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 19:54 - Unknown:  Sure, there are 3 projects, which you shall be working on, right? i.e. African Schools Connect, Community Building, Corporate Alliance.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 19:56 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Can I pick one project at a time</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 21:06 - Unknown:  You can do that Keith! But I would suggest you work on all the projects as they can be easily managed simultaneously! I don't want you to only put your entire focus on one single project because, if you are working in different fields, and are gaining experience in all of them, it would make it easier for you to be a part of the other outsourced projects, which we take up. There are fellow edoofians, who are working on all kinds of projects and are doing really well for building better opportunities for themselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 21:07 - Unknown:  Also, I do not want you to focus entirely on the projects. I would suggest you dedicate just 1 hour of undivided attention to your projects daily! So that you also learn a habit of working regularly and actively.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 21:43 - Unknown:  Hello My Dear Proud Edoofian!</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">07/11/22, 17:14 - Unknown:  Greetings Keith! Yes, it can be in any format. But it has to be a soft copy.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">07/11/22, 17:39 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Good morning Mr Anadi, i would like an extension for the submission sir i have already prepared the newsletter on paper but i haven't typed it yet and i have catch up exams today</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">07/11/22, 23:24 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  It was quite challenging honestly</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">07/11/22, 23:32 - Unknown:  Why?</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/11/22, 23:35 - Unknown:  Are you still writing your exams?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/11/22, 23:37 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  No sir I am done now</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/11/22, 23:38 - Unknown:  Okay! So, did you go through the Wednesday lesson?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/11/22, 23:41 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Yes sir I did</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/11/22, 23:56 - Unknown:  So, can you please share your understanding with me?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 00:00 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  The Wednesday Lesson was about Self awareness, how it is about actually getting to look at yourself and assess yourself and work out a plan to work on your weakness and strength to become a better person. An example of the former president of the USA Mr Barrack Obama was given and various people were testifying to how he took time for self introspection and how it helped him in his life</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 00:18 - Unknown:  Great! So Keith, can you share your strengths and weaknesses, that you must have analyzed about your own self, and how have they played a role in building your personality of today.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:08 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  My greatest weakness is social awkwardness or not being able to interact with people on the get go and I struggle with that a lot because it makes me come across as secluded or unapproachable</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:10 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  My strength is being able to put myself under a situation and seeing it through even when I'm working under pressure I always manage to see the other end of what I am doing</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:12 - Unknown:  That is really impressive, that you understand your own personality! But, do you also understand the fact that, such weakness might put you in trouble when you shall be placed in a professional setup?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:13 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Yes sir and i have been trying to work on them</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:17 - Unknown:  Great! We shall work on it together and try to become a better version of ourselves, every single day.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:17 - Unknown:  So Keith! Are you ready to work on the Projects which we discussed in the Introductory session?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:20 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  I would love that</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:20 - Keith EWYL22E0690:  Yes</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">11/11/22, 01:26 - Unknown:  Great Keith! So, I would suggest you put in at least 1 hour of your day daily, on the corporate alliance and African Schools Reform Project. In the meantime, you can regularly work on community building, as a normal conversation with people can be done at any time of the day, but schools, companies, and professional places have time set to reach out and contact. I hope you get my point.</div></div>
