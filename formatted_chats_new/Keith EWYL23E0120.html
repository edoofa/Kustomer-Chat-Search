This can be a huge help when you are trying to reach your goals, as it can be difficult to do it alone. With the support of others, you are more likely to succeed.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">08/06/23, 17:12 - Keith EWYL23E0120:  The most important lesson is to be adaptable and vigilant: always consider yourself in permanent beta, i.e. as a work in progress, eager to learn and develop. Prioritize learning opportunities. Too often, 20 years of experience really means one year of experience repeated 20 times.Taking intelligent risks requires tolerance and an expectation that education innovation includes both successful and unsuccessful endeavors. Intelligent risk-taking can be cultivated and supported by applying deliberate, thoughtful consideration to both the problem and its potential solutions.*Start-up of you*provides practical strategies to support its concepts, for example  people become entrepreneurs because When starting their own businesses, entrepreneurs are not motivated by what you may think. The main reason most people want to become their own boss is the freedom, satisfaction and flexibility it offers them. Entrepreneurs need to embrace new technology and use it to their benefit to continue growing their startups.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/06/23, 16:28 - Keith EWYL23E0120:  It's my greatest pleasure to share with you my story as an Edoofian. In English circles they say, "Success is the result of perfection, hard work, learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence. ". In order to be successful one has to endure from all the pain of failure which is one of my principles. As an Edoofian, my goal is not only of studying abroad but also to make sure that by the end of my academic years my community must be transformed into an inspirational community. Usually when people grow up they ought to forget that they were raised by the society. The society plays an important role in our upbringing and they make sure that wherever we go we will define the society in a positive manner. When l was a child l challenged myself that one day l will work hard to change my society, in my success story my society must be included. I was very impressed when l was enrolled in the Edoofa program. The program happened to match my goals with its objectives. When l heard of the EWYL program l told myself that this is the chance to create a story in my community. I am working much harder to better my society. I always say, "if l cannot do great things, l can do small things in a great way" hence l am motivating my fellow friends by telling them the good news about Edoofa program. I want to utilize this opportunity to make sure that all hardworking students in my community must be part of Edoofa. By doing this, majority of the parents are really excited as they can see the dreams of their own children coming true. I am finding it interesting in working on my projects because l can see my dream coming true and l will change my community for sure. Last but not least I will end up by saying, "The moment you believe you can't do it, everything else begins to crumble. Never stop believing..."</div></div>
