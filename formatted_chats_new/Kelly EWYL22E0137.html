<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 18:20 - Kelly EWYL22E0137:  I had a very  interesting story of a sailor and the sea which interprets how people can easily blame and give excuses for their failures . Just as the sailor blamed the sea, people also tend to give excuses for not succeeding in life and end up saying failure cannot be escaped.The lesson is to always have a posative mind even if when things are not going your way you should keep on trying as a dollar in the future is better than a dollar today.Always speak good to others because you might learn something from it too.</div></div>
