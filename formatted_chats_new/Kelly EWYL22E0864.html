<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/01/23, 18:48 - Aditi Kapoor:  Hello Kelly, Congratulations on making it to the EWYL Line. Here we practice a 'mantra' where you should always start and end the day by saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' to boost your energy!</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/01/23, 18:49 - Kelly EWYL22E0864:  Alright that’s amazing</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/01/23, 18:49 - Kelly EWYL22E0864:  I am a proud Edoofian</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/01/23, 18:50 - Aditi Kapoor:  So let us start with the Projects we have discussed before. Can you recall what are those 3 projects as discussed before?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/01/23, 18:51 - Aditi Kapoor:  Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/01/23, 19:13 - Aditi Kapoor:  May I know if you have Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead tomorrow.</div></div>

Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.</div></div>
