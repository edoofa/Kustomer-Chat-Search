<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/06/23, 15:54 - Ananya:  Would you like to add What special efforts are you taking to build a better and stronger Edoofa Student Community and ultimately develop a stronger network for yourself?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/06/23, 16:02 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143:  That's right, during this precious and significant time I have spent and still spending with the Edoofa family, I have come to realize that dreams are nothing more than dreams if you as an individual do not act upon them. As of late I have been interacting with members of my community both my age, still in school and much older on the topic and emphasis in the Edoofa Scholarship program itself, it has been a maturing process as of late but in time I hope I will start to see and get results.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/06/23, 16:03 - Ananya:  I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to you for your remarkable dedication to building a better and stronger Edoofa student community.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/06/23, 16:22 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143:  The program is a challenge as members I have account for at this point of time aren't putting that much of enthusiasm in the program, some of them even came up with statements saying they need to see me first go to India as proof it is legit.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/06/23, 16:30 - Ananya:  Well, Kelvin, you recently participated in the Meet and Greet event in Bulawayo, which turned out to be a tremendous success.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">27/06/23, 06:47 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143:  These traits that Ellen Johnson Sirleaf had are an example of resilience, being a woman in a man dominated industry is no joke, the competition had to be stiff, and she had to face criticism on whether she was capable of doing a greater job, and the only thing that kept going for her was resilience. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf had to maintain a clear path in mind to which led to her archieve set desired goals in her life thus becoming the first female president in Africa.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">27/06/23, 06:48 - Kelvin EWYL23E0143:  I would like to add personally that the prospective of being resilience is one of my strong suits, being able to pick out some set desired goals and being able to see them through and all.</div></div>
