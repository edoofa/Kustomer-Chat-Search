<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/12/22, 03:57 - Kirsty EWYL22E0824:  My secret Santa for this festive season is going to be my mother. I'm going to buy her gumboots. My mother loves gardening so much. I want her to wear those gumboots whenever she's at our farm or in our little garden at home.  I want her to feel loved and appreciated each and every second she's wearing those boots. It's a little appreciation of love that am offering. My heart alone can never express how much she mean to me this season, so am buying something for her to show her that she means a lot. Also, am going to make a homemade picture frame of her on her graduation day. She recently graduated with a masters degree but she couldn't attend her graduation ceremony because she had to sacrifice for my enrollment fee for edoofa. The frame is to show her how much of a heroine she is to me and how much l appreciate every single and big thing she does for me and my siblings. For me to be a typical hardworker and woman of faith,she's the reason behind. The reason why l chose my mother to be my secret santa these season is because she's that one person who made me feel whole again this year when l thought of giving up on everything l was working on . She helped me stand on my toes and move again</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/02/23, 07:40 - Unknown:  Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.
