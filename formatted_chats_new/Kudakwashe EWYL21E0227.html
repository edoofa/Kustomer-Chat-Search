<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/11/22, 01:36 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">09/11/22, 17:39 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0227:  My parents always stressed how l should do my best and have to work for the things l want. Growing up I learned this doesn’t come easy. As everything college is upon us I have reflected on these principles and pondered how I will come up with the money for my college education. The clear cut answer is scholarships. You will see in this journey that I am a worthy candidate for this scholarship. There are a few achievements I am proud of, but what I am most proud of is my progress in school. I have always worked hard and tried to get my best grade. I have done pretty well in school and am trying my best in college. I try to develop better study habits and work efficiently.</div></div>
