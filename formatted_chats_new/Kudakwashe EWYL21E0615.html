<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/10/22, 20:32 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615:  I actually l disagree to some extend.Shortcuts as l say its a risk management, there is also a chance to achieve a goal but is endowed with very minimum percentage of success.However to larger scale, shortcuts are doomed to fail because they lack quality planning</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/10/22, 20:32 - Kudakwashe EWYL21E0615:  Likewise from the first quote about good planning, a short cut is a longest distance between 2 points because it is full of uncertainities.No clear future in shortcuts because its prone and inevitable to fail at any time.Shortcuts have not fixed hope to attain an  achievement</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
