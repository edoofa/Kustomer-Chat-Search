In our Wednesday Wisdom this week, we discussed a profitable business- Skooqs. Do you know that Skooqs was developed in just five days!!

The use of the opportunity at the right time with the right skills is currently creating a significant impact on the African entrepreneurial ecosystem.  And well some of you, because of your consistency, diligence, willingness to show up for your sessions, and performance in your weekly activities have gotten this opportunity to work on a project with Skooqs.</div></div>

The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years.
