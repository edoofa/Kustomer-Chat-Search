<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/11/23, 19:26 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854:  During my ordinary level's Zimsec Examinations.l wrote mathematics with a lot of confidence, knowing that l was very good when it comes to this subject. Unfortunately , when the results came l had failed mathematics with a  very worst symbol. I cried each and every day, isolated myself from other children, depressed and very stressed . I even lost my weight . My family comforted me every day , counselling me with warm messages but at that point my mind was not responding to those messages . I had contradicting ideas and views towards my parent's advices . My father told me that he is there to support me and to pay for my examination fees even if l was to write mathematics several times . This message showed me that  my family is the best and my dad is my human diary . My family advised me to write mathematics again saying that it wasn't the end of my life . I wrote mathematics again, working very hard , praying to God , doing group discussions with my lesson mates.Suprisingly , l passed mathematics . I learnt that in life we are here on earth to be corrected from our mistakes. I also learnt that failure is a temporary condition what makes it permanent is giving up .</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/11/23, 15:43 - Aditi Kapoor:  Overcoming a significant setback in failing a mathematics exam, I faced depression and isolation. Despite family support, it was a personal struggle. My father's unwavering support and encouragement motivated me to try again. Through hard work, prayer, and group discussions, I succeeded in the retake, realizing that failure is temporary and perseverance is key to success. The experience taught me the value of learning from mistakes and the importance of not giving up in the face of challenges.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">24/11/23, 15:47 - Kudzai EWYL23E0854:  I also learnt that even the successful people l know , they passed through many challenges right .Those challenges made them to be who are they now . They were being corrected from their mistakes and problems right . For example Michael Jordan</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">24/11/23, 15:51 - Aditi Kapoor:  Your understanding is insightful and inspiring. Recognizing that fulfilling goals often involves navigating through challenging phases is a valuable perspective.
