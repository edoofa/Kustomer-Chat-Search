I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/08/22, 16:07 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/08/22, 16:16 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0726:  First of all I would like to say ,where l come from is my biggest inspiration . Having had grown in a high density suburb ,I faced a lot of problems as a young kid and watched many kids face many kinds of problems too .My main goal is to improve the lives of little kids in my community . Everyday I watched many children go to school bare footed with no food .I watched many teenagers waste their lives doing drugs because their parents couldn't cater for their education .So this had a very big impact on Kudzaishe .I wish to make my community and where l come from a better environment for children .I want to help those who are in need and make their lives better .So whenever I am doing something ,I always ask myself ,is what I'm doing bringing me a step close to where l wanna reach .My strong desire and passion for change always pushes me into working hard and has been moulding me into a better person</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/08/22, 19:31 - Unknown:  The Wednesday Wisdom Lesson this week will focus on three business success stories that went from rags to riches. Additionally, social learning is a very effective method of learning. You can learn from the mistakes and accomplishments of others, so you don't have to figure everything out on your own, for instance.</div></div>
