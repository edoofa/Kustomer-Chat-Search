<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 18:12 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739:  Patrice started out small and grew his way up. This is totally a challenge because some of us hope to be successful in a day. Patrice kept on working hard and learning new stuff across the years which resulted in his success later on. We need to push ourselves every day because we have the potential just like Patrice did.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 18:42 - Unknown:  I am glad that the text inspired you but can you elaborate a bit where he said you do not always need a teacher to learn?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 22:04 - Kudzaishe EWYL21E0739:  That js totally right. Sometimes if you want to move forward with your life and make changes to circumstances, you have to do it yourself. You do not need a lecture or a tutorial to get things done but you have to take that step and be willing to learn and figure out things by yourself as you go.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 22:13 - Unknown:  Right but again do you realise the opportunity here. You have a mentor available for you to do things for you , to tell you about stuff but you have to gauge it.</div></div>

I am sure you will agree to the fact that Attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
