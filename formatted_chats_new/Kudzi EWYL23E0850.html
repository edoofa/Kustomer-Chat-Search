<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/12/23, 13:12 - Unknown:  I understand the frustration of receiving messages late. Let's  troubleshoot this together. First, try restarting your phone to ensure  it's not a temporary glitch. Check if your phone has the latest software  updates, as outdated software can sometimes cause communication issues.  Additionally, verify your network connection and consider switching  between Wi-Fi and mobile data to see if there's any improvement.</div></div>

The reason behind this idea of grouping students was inorder to have a clear discussion, a question and answer session so that everyone gets equiped with the correct knowledge, and as for my next project I'd like to improve my communication skills and to be brave enough and  also try to work extra harder inorder to attain best results, thank you.</div></div>
