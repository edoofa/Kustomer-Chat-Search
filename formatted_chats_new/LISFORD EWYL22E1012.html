<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/05/23, 15:11 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  I'm sharing my understanding of the Wednesday wisdom below as instructed</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/05/23, 15:13 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  From the Wednesday Wisdom on servant leadership and the experiences of our founders, Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh, I have gained valuable insights. They exemplify the characteristics of servant leaders by putting the needs of others first, promoting a sense of community, and fostering personal and professional growth.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">18/05/23, 18:56 - Ananya:  I appreciate you for sharing the Wednesday lesson's understanding with me, it is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.</div></div>

Africa's achievements and progress are indeed worth celebrating, and we also acknowledge the challenges that we must address.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 18:25 - Ananya:  Great, would you like to share your thoughts on it?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 18:27 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Sure let me do</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 18:40 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Self-awareness is a powerful yet often overlooked skill that shapes our lives and careers. Recognized by the World Health Organization, it holds immense potential for well-being and success. Personally, I value determination, adaptability, and listening skills as my strengths. However, I face a hindrance in tolerating disrespect within teams. By cultivating self-awareness, I aim to address this challenge, developing assertiveness and conflict resolution skills. Through introspection and growth, I will unlock my true potential and make a meaningful impact in both personal and professional realms.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 18:40 - Ananya:  I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 18:52 - Ananya:  Lisford,I want to emphasize the significance of this session so that you fully understand its importance. I have set aside this specific time slot exclusively for you. It is crucial that you are attentive and responsive during our discussion. Quick and timely replies are essential because if we are not able to communicate efficiently, it may hinder our progress and potentially lead to delays in completing our projects on time.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 18:52 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Thank you, like him I will continue trying exploring and identifying my own traits, be more self-aware and use it as an advantage both in the personal and professional realms</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 18:54 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by my lack of attentiveness and delayed replies during our session. I understand the importance of this dedicated time and the impact it has on our progress and project timelines. Moving forward, I will ensure to be fully present, attentive, and responsive in our discussions. Your guidance and support are invaluable to me, and I appreciate your understanding.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 18:56 - Ananya:  I feel a sense of disappointment regarding today's session, and I have certain expectations for our next session. While I understand that you may have encountered some challenges or issues, I kindly request that you make a sincere effort to be punctual in our future sessions. The next session is going to be a video session on Saturday. I will share the link shorty!</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 17:59 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Good afternoon</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 17:59 - Ananya:  Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:00 - Ananya:  How are you today? How was your weekend?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:01 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  I'm doing good, how are you. The weekend was great, how was yours?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:05 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Thank you for sharing the story of Andy the ant with me. I found it inspiring and meaningful. The moral of the story, as I see it, is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. Additionally, the story emphasizes the importance of persistence and teamwork in achieving our goals and making a difference in the world. It reminds us that if we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. I appreciate the lesson conveyed by this story, and I will keep it in mind as I continue to pursue my own goals and dreams.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:07 - Ananya:  May I know if you have attended the event or you will be going to Bulawayo?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:13 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  I did not attend the event and sadly I also can't make it to Bulawayo. Due to a situation I will only be able to travel to Zimbabwe next week.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:16 - Ananya:  That is alright, do not worry let me share a few insights with you.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:17 - Ananya:  Our meet and greet event was an astounding success, and I am delighted to offer you an exclusive preview of the occasion. I hope you will enjoy watching this!🎉</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:20 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Thank you for sharing the vedio, it's so exciting to see how big the community is</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:29 - Ananya:  Now, may I ask if you were able to read the Wednesday lesson and complete your weekend activity?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:31 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012: </div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:38 - Ananya:  Great, now would you like to tell some qualities of a gold personality?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:45 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  A person with a gold personality is detail-oriented and enjoys planning ahead. They seek security and predictability, preferring structured environments and well-defined duties. They value history, tradition, and have high moral standards. Others might describe them as responsible rule-followers who believe in doing things "by the book." They enjoy being relied upon and strive to live out their values through volunteering or career choices. Gold individuals are well-suited for straightforward jobs in finance or public service</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:47 - Ananya:  That is great, so do you agree that you have a gold personality?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:48 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Not entirely</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:48 - Ananya:  Why so?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 18:55 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  I have some of my own traits that diverge with those of a gold personality.  I can't say I'm a straight by the book person, if I can improvise, I go for it, if it is for the better or if I see it can give a better result. At times I believe being a straight by the book person gives you restrictions and limitations and I'd I ain't that kind of person to settle for less. Also I believe myself to be a person who is flexible,  one can adapt to various work environments and I don't feel 'straight forward jobs' mentioned in the description is me. I think that's it</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 19:00 - Ananya:  I appreciate that you have a capability of self analysis, it is crucial for self growth and development. Also, yes I agree that improvising according to the situation is good and important when it comes to being diversified.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 19:04 - Ananya:  Since, your session time is over now, we shall connect in our next session to discuss our projects.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 19:45 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Thank you for acknowledging the importance of self analysis and growth</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/06/23, 20:26 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a remarkable leader and the first female president in Africa, embodies determination, resilience, and visionary leadership. Her journey teaches us valuable lessons: embrace challenges as opportunities for growth, navigate through chaos with courage, prioritize integrity and fight corruption, break gender barriers, value education and empower youth, foster collaboration and diplomacy, and promote environmental stewardship. Sirleaf's inspiring life serves as a source of motivation and guidance for all of us on our journey towards becoming successful professionals and lifelong learners.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/07/23, 13:49 - LISFORD EWYL22E1012:  From the provided lesson, I understood that exposure to a wide range of ideas and experiences enhances creative thinking by expanding the mind and stimulating the imagination. By being exposed to diverse sources of inspiration, individuals can fuel their creativity, make unique connections, and generate novel ideas. Additionally, questioning assumptions and challenging the status quo is crucial for fostering innovative thinking. This mindset encourages individuals to explore possibilities, break free from conventional thinking patterns, and find new solutions and perspectives.</div></div>
