Till today it's still the only thing I want to be. People would tell me how being a lawyer would not make me rich but is really not about the money for me but helping me who can't afford to help themselves, bringing justice to those that where wronged is what makes me want to be a lawyer. I wish to start my own practice some day and I know because of the Edoofa Scholarship program I'm one step closer to achieving my goals</div></div>
