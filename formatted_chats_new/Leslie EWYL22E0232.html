On Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">27/07/22, 03:56 - Leslie EWYL22E0232:  The growth mindset of successful people is that they are responsible for their actions whether the result of their actions is a success or failure and accept accountability for their own choices and results. I believe for one to develop this kind of mindset is to surround himself with other successful people with this kind of mindset because as lots of quotes say the people you spend most of your time with determine your future. Also it also requires commitment. One has to set the goal and  focus themself to accomplish it. To add on, you also have to give yourself time as it is not easy to adapt a mindset like this.</div></div>

People who are able to mange their time are able to do so once they understand the difference between urgent and important tasks. Urgent tasks are the ones that require our immediate attention but they may not matter to us and important tasks are those that consequences if not done. One can use the priority matrix to help manage his time</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/08/22, 23:46 - Unknown:  A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with ,e as part of your Saturday activity in a tabular format that you can check on the internet.You can draw it on paper and show it to me.. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.</div></div>
