<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 22:20 - Unknown:  I read your response Liberty and you know it made me so inquisitive about the manufacturing industries in Zimbabwe look what I found  manufacturing sector has gone through a decade of de-industrialization and is currently experiencing low capacity utilization levels, low productivity levels and this has taken away the competitiveness that the local manufacturers need to compete with foreign products.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 22:21 - Unknown:  The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. RitualsÂ motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

We learnt that we should not blame others if we fail. To achieve, someone must be focused, determined and willingness. In life people who blame others eventually end up being loosers</div></div>
