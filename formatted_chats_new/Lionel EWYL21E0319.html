<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 01:26 - Aditi Kapoor:  I read your response to your weekend activity and it made me so inquisitive to know about the mining industry I got to know that predominant minerals mined by the industry include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds. The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 01:26 - Aditi Kapoor:  The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:17 - Aditi Kapoor:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 19:42 - Lionel EWYL21E0319:  Successful people  has a mindset that is way better than unsuccessful people  because they never take failure  as some one fault  but rather take it as lifetime  lessons. They often grow in becoming more successful people  because they often adopt the theory  of benchmarking  ,copying what is best in someone or company. So as of me  inorder to develop  the same character  l will erase a mentality  of failure  in me ,that if something  has failed it has no second  chance but rather successful people they take failure  as challenge  ,so me l will develop  tht mindset  from the first day of my tertiary  education that for every failure  l should  not give up but rather take the challenge  serious and correct  my mistakes  cause in every failure  they are some loopholes .</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r</div></div>
