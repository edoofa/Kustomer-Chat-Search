<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 17:44 - Lisa EWYL21E0941:  The skills or practices that a student must uphold in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits are 1. Discipline into consistency, discipline takes people far and it’s hard to be consistently disciplined and it takes a lot of hard work to rely on discipline to accomplish what you know you should do therefore as students we should be consistently disciplined in order to archive more in life. Another skill is diligence, as students we should not get tired or bored with tasks and projects we should have that diligence in us to help us continue and work hard. Willingness to show up for our sessions and performance in our weakly activities is another skill that we should have. As Edoofians we should also practice the daily ritual of sending the proud Edoofian message to our mentors. By performing the skills and practices above and more I’m sure one would qualify to get to work on a project with skoops.</div></div>
