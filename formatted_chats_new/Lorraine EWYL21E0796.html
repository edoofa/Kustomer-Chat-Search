<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/08/22, 17:52 - Jasmine Kaur:  A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with ,e as part of your Saturday activity in a tabular format that you can check on the internet.You can draw it on paper and show it to me.. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.</div></div>
