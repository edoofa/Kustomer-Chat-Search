<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">08/11/23, 14:07 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681:  I have managed to contact the Headmaster from the nearest school and contacted her already. Have scheduled a meeting so far. As for the other schools lam still making an effort to get their contacts. Unfortunately most contact details for head masters are personal contacts and private so they are hesitant to share. However the larger part of the efforts currently is to establish communications and share with them the edoofa program so that most graduating students may stand a chance to benefit from the program</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">08/11/23, 14:17 - Aditi Kapoor:  That's excellent to hear that you've already taken the initiative to contact the Headmaster of the nearest school and have a meeting scheduled. Your dedication to expanding the reach of the Edoofa program is commendable. I understand that obtaining contact information for other schools' headmasters can be challenging, but your efforts in establishing communication and sharing the program's opportunities are essential in giving graduating students a chance to benefit from it. Keep up the good work, and I wish you success in your outreach efforts! If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/11/23, 14:38 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681:  Mastering our circumstances has reminded me what Mahatma Ghandi once said "Be the change that you wish to see in the world". This brings out valuable lessons on how one can navigate through obstacles life presents and using them as stepping stones to shape our destiny in life.This can only be possible with the right mindset we adopt, the choices we make in life and surrounding ourselves with positive influences. Every small or big decision we make daily shape our destiny and determines who we will become. Focusing on improving oneself may sound selfish but it's the only way leading to being selfless and ultimately contributing to society. By mastering yourself, one can forge their own destiny. It is the ultimate test one would ever face in life. It represents the ultimate goal in your life. Alex as given in the article used transformative power of mastering his circumstances through education and ultimately contributed positively to his society thereby benefitting larger part of members of his society. Its the power of a mindset, the power of mastery which encompasses self awareness, self knowledge and self development</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/11/23, 20:13 - Lushomo EWYL23E0681:  Personal experience involves certain challenges l faced which included low self-esteem and anxiety. Some of the poorest decisions l have ever made have been under the influence of these emotions, and my actions were driven by fear. Over the years l have l experienced moments were l felt separate from my own life as if a strnger was in charge of my choices. These experiences were certainly not the most empowering. It took me time and a lot effort to realise that l have power over what l listen and influences my mind. I realized that l have power over my mind and behaviour and lam the only one who can deceide whether theres a more positive approach to let these emotions consume me or whether to simply feel them and let them go. In short l have developed the power over the dialogue in my mind.</div></div>
