I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it.</div></div>
