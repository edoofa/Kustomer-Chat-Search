<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 21:46 - Makanaka EWYL22E0215:  One has to have a lot of outstanding skills in order to be given the chance to participate in projects and earn more scholarship credits. Firstly one has to have critical thinking. With critical thinking, your thinking abilities are not limited and you tend to think outside the box. With critical thinking you are someone who has deep thinking into things and your opinions over how something should be done rule over others. Secondly, one should have good time management. When you are able to manage your time well you become capable of finishing your projects in time even when you are given a certain deadline. Thirdly, one should be a problem solver with some great problem solving skills. With this, you a re able to tackle anything you are given to do and you should be someone who is quick to engage into the problems around the project making sure to solve them straight away. Lastly, one should also have good communication skills. When you are doing a project or any work somehow you are going to seek for the assistance of others or if not, you will be working with others sometimes. Good communication skills are needed for better communication and understanding and for a peaceful environment for you to work on your project. They as well say, where there is peace, there is prosperity!</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 16:07 - Makanaka EWYL22E0215:  Successful people don't easily blame others for their mistakes or failures. Why? This is because already they would have worked hard to get where they want for them to be called successful. They would have fallen, risen, tripled, staggered, walked straight up again, frowned, smiled the next minute. It all comes from the mind. They know they very much want to reach a certain goal so they are never disturbed or intimidated by the odds. I think for one to be successful you need to have a sharp mindset. By sharp mindset I mean you have to be focused on the goal you need to reach. Great people always say 'Press on towards your goal' . If one does so and remains in the lane, you never go wrong. Even if some mistakes or failures come along your way you are never moved because even if you fall, you know are still pressing towards your goal. I also think that for one to develop a successful mindset which accepts failure, you got to know how to work well with people. They are always there if we want some advice and we never know when they will be useful so pride aside no matter how successful you are! Because they are the same people who are going to stand with you the times you fail.</div></div>

I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r</div></div>
