<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">17/03/23, 23:24 - Makanaka EWYL22E0918:  I understood that one should not chase after money and status.  wealth give happiness and peace of mind unlike money and status</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/03/23, 23:30 - Aditi Kapoor:  You have expressed a very insightful perspective on the role of wealth, money, and status in our lives. It is true that chasing after money and status can often lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction, as these things are not necessarily the key to true happiness and peace of mind.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/03/23, 23:30 - Aditi Kapoor:  Instead, focusing on cultivating a sense of contentment and fulfillment in our daily lives, regardless of our material possessions or social status, can lead to a much deeper and more satisfying sense of happiness and well-being.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/03/23, 23:30 - Aditi Kapoor:  Ultimately, the pursuit of wealth and status can be a never-ending and exhausting cycle, while true inner peace and fulfillment come from finding meaning and purpose in our lives, and connecting with others in meaningful ways.</div></div>
