<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">23/07/22, 14:05 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">23/07/22, 14:06 - Makomborero EWYL21E0937:  Good morning ma'am . Iam kindly apologizing for my absence in the past weeks . I am now ready to continue my EWYL</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
