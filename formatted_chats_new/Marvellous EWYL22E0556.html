<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">09/01/23, 22:40 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556:  What are you looking for in a pen? Do you love your pens? And do you have that one go -to pen that you use on impossible occasions because you know it writes well and looks great? What do you use a pen for? Do you jot down notes during a meeting or phone call? Do you sometimes use a pen to sign important documents or contracts, or even letters or Christmas cards? And if you use a pen in front of others, do the optics matter to you? Would you prefer to use the kind of pen used by well to do people, or will just any old pen do?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">Perfect. The thing about nice pens is they not only look good, but they write great. This pen right here is one of our newer models. It has some gold platting on top of sterling silver, but it's not all that heavy. And it's write like a dream. Take it, find a piece of paper on your desk and sign your name. You don't have to scribble on a piece of scratch paper first to see if the ink comes out _ I guarantee you the ink will come out.  And it's not expensive - Unknown: it's valuable. You can afford this pen , and you can carry it with you everywhere. Refillable cartridges will make sure you never run out of ink. Tell you what, keep the pen a week, use it's everyday, see if it's disappoints you. I'll come back next time, and if you don't like it, I'll take it away.if you do like it , but you'd like to see some other options, I'll bring you some other options. But this pen is yours to use for free for a week. No obligation.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">09/01/23, 22:42 - Saloni Rastogi:  Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/01/23, 22:06 - Saloni Rastogi:  I know you must have messaged so many leaders, founders, managers, associates, and many more people on their LinkedIn but haven't received any response yet I can completely understand this because most of the time these leaders are occupied in their daily routines and often do not get time to respond to messages. Since our focus has always been to earn scholarship credit, we will just wait for 1 to 2 days for their reply but in case they don't reply, I have an alternative through which you can earn scholarship credits.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/01/23, 22:07 - Saloni Rastogi:  What you can do is Google the information about the company and bring it to me through the form. For example, if there is a company named ABCD and we have sent a message to the leader of the company and he has not replied for 1 to 2 days. Don't wait any more time. We can google the name of the company, search for all the relevant information that is required in the form like the name of the company, name of the contact person, designation of the person, and so on, fill out the form and share it with me.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/23, 06:51 - Marvellous EWYL22E0556:  The problem was within the family not on my own so we had to solve it as a  family. Here came my sister who's 20 years old and she's doing grade 9 the second born in our family. Suddenly she just came and said she wants to get married, us as sisters were there, shocked about her decision cause she's still in school. We tried to show her all the possible outcome of early marriage and tried to stop her from getting married, we showed her the importance of education as well but she wasn't ready to take it. It's took a while she just came and said if u guys won't allow me to get married I'll commit suicide. We had no solution solution but the only one that we had to so we can reserve the life of our sister. That's when we gave concern for her to get married despite her agement and education before her.</div></div>
