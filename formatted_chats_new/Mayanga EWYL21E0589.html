<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/10/22, 18:32 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/10/22, 18:01 - Unknown:  Greetings Mayanga!</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/10/22, 18:02 - Unknown:  I hope you remember that every morning when you wake up, you have to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' on the EWYL Line.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/10/22, 18:02 - Unknown:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/10/22, 18:02 - Unknown:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/10/22, 18:16 - Mayanga EWYL21E0589:  Ok l thought l do it when I have sessions l will do that every day</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:50 - Unknown:  That's great Mayanga.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:50 - Unknown:  We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 01:06 - Mayanga EWYL21E0589:  Thank u</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 23:27 - Mayanga EWYL21E0589:  I learnt that we should not do shortcuts when doing something . I also learnt that even if we don’t have enough resources and people are not supporting us we should not give up and keep on trying to do the things we love .</div></div>
