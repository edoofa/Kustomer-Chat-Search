<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/11/22, 19:04 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 00:01 - Unknown:  Edoofian, Punctuality in school life builds the path to success in a student's life by enabling them to plan ahead, make an efficient routine, and be prepared for their tasks. A punctual student is better equipped to deal with their day-to-day tasks than a person who leaves it for the last moment. Please note that we would only be able to earn the desired amount of credits if we are punctual at our session timings.</div></div>
