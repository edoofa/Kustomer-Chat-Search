At school level one is given school projects which means dealing with real-world problems and bringing in profit for the company. There are certain skills which are required for one to participate in projects and attain higher scholarship credits. These include courage,obedience,hard-working,honest,respect and team work. Courage is important because if one lacks that nothing can work out and it will also take away self-confidence. Obedience comes from listening to the instructions and also being upto date with any specific project given. Hard working is important because it reduces work load and also it can attract many business project to you. Lastly team work is something which most students find it difficult to do. Doing team work can reduce the work and also it helps to find solutions very fast compared being alone.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 18:54 - Mercy EWYL21E0769:  In the story of Patrice l learnt that if you have a passion with something ,try until you succeed. Even if the world see no light just continue sailing until you reach your destination. I also learnt that giving up is not good as no one knows what tomorrow holds,things might change overnight. I was inspired by the fact that he became the first black person to partner with whites during the colonization era. He is an inspiration to the Africans and it also made me want to work hard and achieve my goals in the same manner</div></div>
