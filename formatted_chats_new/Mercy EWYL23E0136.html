<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/09/23, 13:37 - Mercy EWYL23E0136:  To effectively plan for an examination l have these tips and strategies that l think would help someone preparing for an examination. To effectively plan for an exam, l would advise someone to map out a study plan which can be 2 or three weeks before an examination. This will allow someone to avoid cramming and also help in alleviating stress. One has to make a revision schedule that is realistic and that suits him or her. The person has to personalize his or her notes in a way that is understandable. one of the best way to do so is to look at the past exam papers so that you familialize yourself with exam questions. After reading one also need to sit down and relax so as to freshen up the mind. Lastly, reward yourself to keep going.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/09/23, 12:52 - Mercy EWYL23E0136:  The Wednesday wisdom was all about freelancing. Freelancing refers to a work arrangement in which individuals, often called freelancers or independent contractors offer their services to clients or other companies on a project by project basis without being fully employed. The freelancers are self employed and work independently, providing services in various fields for example writing, design, programming, marketing and consulting. The freelancers are of benefits to us students who are looking forward to earn while persuing our studies. The characteristics of a freelancer include being independent, remote working, self employed, variable income , networking and freedom. It is a reward to the people who value flexibility, indep3ndence and the opportunity to work on diverse projects however it comes with its own challenges including need for self discipline, responsibility of managing all aspects of one's business and potential for income fluctuations. Successful freelancers often develop a strong online presence, market their services effectively and continuously upgrade their skills to stay competitive in their chosen field.</div></div>
