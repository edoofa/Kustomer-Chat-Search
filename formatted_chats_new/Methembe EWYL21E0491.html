The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it, yet.</div></div>
