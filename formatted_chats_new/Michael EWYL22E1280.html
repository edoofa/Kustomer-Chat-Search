<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">31/05/23, 13:34 - Michael EWYL22E1280:  I understand that I am introvert. I am more in my head in my own head than I am social. Part of the report from the personality test said I am an intelligent person, and I totally agree and even my siblings will agree, they even call me the family nerd for that sake. This is secret few people know, during my A level I spent the money I was given for extra lessons on other things. I didn't go for extra lessons because I knew that with exceptional "understanding" I would pass without going for extra lessons.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">06/07/23, 11:20 - Michael EWYL22E1280:  I do have a personal experience related to consistency. Achieving my fitness goals; it requires a lot of consistency for you to achieve your physical goals. It took a lot of time for me before I began seeing good results, I even felt demotivated along the way but I had to be consistent to get where I am. I used to be very skinny but now I'm at a point where my mind goes like 😎😎 whenever I look at my body in the mirror. I still have a long way to go and I need to be *consistent* to achieve my ultimate fitness goals. As one Instagrammer once said: *"motivation keeps you going, but consistency keeps you growing"* ✊.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">06/07/23, 13:21 - Michael EWYL22E1280:  A lot of the people, *like almost everyone* I'm informing about Edoofa has either been already enrolled into Edoofa or has been enrolled by another program. Yesterday I went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get my documents authenticated for my visa application, I met someone there who I went to school with 7 years ago. And he was there for the same reason as me. He was also enrolled into Edoofa and I was like "whaaaat me too". And I also realised that 13 other random people who were also there were enrolled into Edoofa and were there for the same purpose. Even on Thursday last week when I went to the Zimbabwe School Examination Council _(ZIMSEC)_ to get my certificates certified _(also for my visa application)_ I also met a bunch of random people there who were *all* enrolled by Edoofa also there to get their certificates certified. Everywhere I'm going I cross paths with an Edoofian.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/07/23, 13:22 - Jasmine Kaur:  It's wonderful to hear that you recognized the importance of consistency in your fitness journey. Often, progress in any area of life takes time, and it's during those challenging moments when consistency becomes even more crucial. There may have been times when you felt demotivated or faced obstacles, but your commitment to consistency allowed you to push through and continue working towards your goals.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">06/07/23, 13:37 - Michael EWYL22E1280:  But I have a plan. When I get there I'll make videos of my experience and share them so that other people can see for themselves how amazing it is to be studying in India rather than to be just told by mouth that it's wonderful this and that. *It's very hard to appreciate the beauty of something unless one sees it with their own eye(s).* For instance let's say I'm told that there's a beautiful lady whom I can marry, I'll obviously want to see that lady for myself before I decide on marrying her. The same concept applies here.</div></div>
