<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 23:45 - Mihlayonke EWYL22E0345:  Mining, agriculture,banking etc i could list as much different sectors but amongst the listed we realised a high growth rate in the àgriculture sector. As a developing country, it means we have to rely on the extraction which is the primary level of production. Zimbabwe as a technological ineffective country it has the ability to extract the raw materials but inability to process the materials. Example given the mining sector would have been ranked number one growing industry but due to inadequate machinery to process mineral ore to a perfect piece of jewel, it lost the number one title.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 01:19 - Aditi Kapoor:  I read your response and it made me so inquisitive about the agriculture sector in Zimbabwe, and what i got to know is  in Zimbabwe is overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 18% of Zimbabwe's GDP as of 2015. Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. There are different crops that farmers grow and some of these include, maize, sorghum, rapoko, groundnuts, round-nuts and beans.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 01:20 - Aditi Kapoor:  The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
