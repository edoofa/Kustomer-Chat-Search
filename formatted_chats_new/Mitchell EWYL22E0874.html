I really wish to be my grandmother's secret Santa. You know I'm still a school student I'm not working yet, so I don't have money to buy her fancy gifts, but this does not stop me from being her secret Santa. From the deepest part of my heart I will make an album containing all my photos with her from since my childhood. I want to show her that I value our memories together and I want to show her that she means a lot to me. I want to remind her that she will always be in my heart. I will also write a letter and put it inside the gift box along with the photo album. In the letter I will pour my heart to her appreciating everything she had done for me since my childhood.</div></div>

So my dear Mentor I'm going to tell you how my family celebrates Christmas.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/12/22, 00:35 - Mitchell EWYL22E0874:  During Christmas and New Year more than three quarters of our relatives come to our home to spent the holiday. Most of the time my dad stays in South Africa since it is where he works. Towards Christmas he comes home along with his younger brother and his family, also along with his 2 sisters and their children. I also have an aunt who stays in another town called Inyanga which is the largest mountain in Zimbabwe aslo comes to our home with her 4 daughters and 3 grandchildren. Other relatives from my mom's side also come to our home for celebration. On the Christmas day itself most of my dad's friends come to our home with their families for celebration. Towards Christmas my mom goes to South Africa to buy new clothes and shoes for us to wear on Christmas and New Year's day and also more food for people to eat. We don't usually go to other people's homes or to our relatives but they come to our home since our yard is very large to accommodate a lot of people. We usually kill a cow or many goats and many chickens for the celebration. The celebration starts on the night before the Christmas day. The relatives return to their homes after New Year. We usually pray before starting the celebration.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/03/23, 22:57 - Unknown:  The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.","transform":"</div></div>
