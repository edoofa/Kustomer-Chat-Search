<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/11/23, 15:08 - Monalisa EWYL23E0731:  Most of my life everything that happens to me has been a lesson that is helping me lately.I remember an incident that happened when I was at the age of twelve .Me and my family went for a Conference.My parents have a leadership part at church so many people know them for helping others especially those in need.l shared a tent with my mom and my little brother at night.Once I was sleeping I felt someone touching my body in an unusual way,that person came on top of me while touching me ,by then I had no idea of what he was doing so l didn't move then someone opened the tent that's how he stopped touching me.I didn't see his face but I knew his scent. I didn't tell anyone about this incident till now because I don't know what he did to me was wrong.I started to hate going to church because of that incident l also felt disgusted with my body l felt unclean in front of God, but likely I got help from my mentor Father Mashoko.If he did not encourage me in being what l am today now I pray,fast and believe that they is a God up there.I always wanted to seek revenge on the guy who took advantage of my age for a long time but now I can't because God exposed him now he is in jail because he raped an underaged girl.</div></div>
