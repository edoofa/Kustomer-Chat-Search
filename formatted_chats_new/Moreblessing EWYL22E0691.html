<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/11/22, 22:29 - Moreblessing EWYL22E0691:  My aims are to work extremely hard both in my education and my EWYL program so as to acquire the maximum scholarship credits which will in turn minimize my annual fees further, thereby reducing my parents expenses. I would really love it if I'm able to earn $150 worth scholarship credits to finish my registration fee before my A-level results are out. I want to be able to multitask, use time wisely, do everything at its own time and remain super active. I hope to have advanced my communication skills which will be an added advantage in my career and also make me a better person.Good time management will also help me finish my tasks in time and still be left with time to socialize and be with family.</div></div>
