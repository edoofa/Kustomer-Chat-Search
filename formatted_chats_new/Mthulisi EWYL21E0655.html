Now, the majority of successful people also adhere to a select few other success mantras. I want you to share with me the success mantra that best suits your personality and that you have already mastered as part of this week's assignment. Share a success habit that you wish to develop this year in order to master it by the end of the year. Thirdly, I want you to describe your role model and the success behaviors you admire most about them in a short essay.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/08/22, 22:10 - Unknown:  As I shared with you yesterday, this week's Wednesday Wisdom focused on three business success stories that went from rags to riches and became epitome of motivation. Did you read the story shared by Ms Davi?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">26/08/22, 00:41 - Mthulisi EWYL21E0655:  The things that led to the success of all the three man is that in everything they were doing they had faith and also that they worked very hard for change as we see that CDE modi got another job were he was paid $250 better money than his previous job.Also as the one who gained profit through selling of phones we realize how clever he was though he was still at school.This people did not care about the how agly the places are to live but they only did what can lead them to success.As for i who also deems to become a successful human being i have learnt a lot that sometimes being that type of a child with less clothes does not mean it won't be good for me and these people inspire me to an extent that i see so much change towards everything that i have dreamt of.Furthermore,am grateful they made it in life and can probably imagine how rich they are today after their hard work.</div></div>
