<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">01/06/23, 21:48 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302:  Good evening. I have watched the reel, I understand the concerns that the edoofian raised on the legitimacy of Scholarships. But judging from the Testimonials of Edoofians in India I can tell that Edoofa is a world class Scholarship program. From the way they are interested in the student's daily life you can tell that the Edoofa Mentors take good care of their students. It's good to know that Wherever i am going I will be secure with you guys.</div></div>

The idea that internal growth is crucial and arguably more important than external growth resonates with many individuals.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/07/23, 14:10 - Aditi Kapoor:  It can be anything which you can record on a video and should be a good skill you can present</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/07/23, 14:10 - Aditi Kapoor:  Hello, my dearEdoofian! I hope you're well and ready for our Saturday Activity. Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">01/07/23, 23:21 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302:  If I were to be a protagonist , my Story line would begin with a young men who had grown for close to 18 years but never really understood where he was going. A young man who went to school simply because he had to, but never really understood the core importance of Education. Just like many I had no idea as to what life brings to us, what choices are right for you and which ones aren't. It's quite sad if you think of it, that I only got these answers recently after High School, but quite the Privilege considering that my career path is just getting started.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:12 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302:  I am ready</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:18 - Aditi Kapoor:  Your realization about the real world being vastly different from the structured environment of school is an eye-opening experience. Understanding the struggles that individuals face in order to provide for their families and invest in their children's futures is a humbling revelation. The wisdom you gained from those conversations, emphasizing the importance of personal development, financial literacy, and professionalism, is invaluable.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:18 - Aditi Kapoor:  I admire your determination to make the most of your youthful days and not squander them on unproductive pleasures. Your definition of success, beyond mere material wealth, is truly inspiring. The freedom to choose your associations, to do good without financial setbacks, and to stay true to your beliefs is a remarkable goal. Your desire to create a safe space for your companions and positively impact the lives of underprivileged people reflects a selfless and compassionate mindset.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:18 - Aditi Kapoor:  You understand that success requires dreams accompanied by hard work, discipline, and optimistic thinking. Your commitment to investing in education, both through formal channels and by connecting with successful individuals, showcases your drive to grow and become a successful person. I wholeheartedly agree that tertiary education is a stepping stone toward building profitable empires and achieving your goals.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:18 - Aditi Kapoor:  I want to commend you for realizing the importance of these principles sooner rather than later. Your story is a testament to the power of personal growth and the transformative impact it can have on one's life. I believe that with your determination, resilience, and the wisdom you've acquired, you are well on your way to achieving the success you envision.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:24 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302:  I appreciate this very much. Especially coming from you.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:33 - Mthungameli EWYL22E1302:  I think I will start by doing the community building project first. Then If I can get enough time I will also do the Schools reforms project.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:36 - Aditi Kapoor:  That is perfect! However the target for the community building is 10 forms for this week.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/07/23, 13:36 - Aditi Kapoor:  It may seem a lot too but the Grant can be upto $1000 dollars so you have to give it your best and work a bit extra for to be on top of the competetion</div></div>
