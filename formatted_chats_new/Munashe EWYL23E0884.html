<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">27/11/23, 18:50 - Munashe EWYL23E0884:  Spirit of competition is the willpower to win ,enjoyment to compete and recognition of the opponents efforts to succeed.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">The spirit of competition triggered something  in me that not to quit( never giving up). I remember well when l was at my ordinary level in athletic season , everyone was into athletes  and it was a stiff competition which grew stiffer day by day as selection proceeds to remain with only the best 100m sprint race.l made progress until  we were five (4 opponents) . I knew l had to man up and move an extra mile on my training. Surprisingly l was selected  and we were now only two , me and the other opponent - Unknown:  he was known for setting records that no one could break .From this time l knew this was the of my season shining .Before we raced l even thought of forfeiting but l just did not believe that it was the end so l raced and surely l did not win as l had already doubted myself . Night  fell and l couldn't sleep thinkin  about what happened  that day . I told myself  l'm not a quitter    l have  to ask for another  race . Starting that night the athletes courts was my habitat day in and day out . Days drew closer for the final competition yet l had not improved on my time . I continued and to my surprise l improved . The big day arrived and l told myself it was going to be "then or never ." We got on track and l blasted  out the champion for the first time . Everyone was surprised.  I felt competition was some life teaching . I learnt that spirit of competition is worthy otherwise l wasn't going to be recognised as a champion too .</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">27/11/23, 18:55 - Munashe EWYL23E0884:  The way to tackle challenges changed , this helped me to note that in every circumstance come up with a strategy and have the willpower to work it through .</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">27/11/23, 18:58 - Munashe EWYL23E0884:  For the projects ma'am lm reaching a dead end , lm trying to reach out to other principals but to no avail . And as for the community building  the colleagues are not decided yet for me to create the group and add them</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">27/11/23, 22:38 - Aditi Kapoor:  Your journey in athletics, especially the 100m sprint race, is truly inspiring. It's remarkable how the spirit of competition became a catalyst for your determination and resilience. The realization that the spirit of competition encompasses the will to win, the enjoyment of the competition, and the recognition of opponents' efforts is profound. It's interesting how you mention that the spirit of competition taught you that it's "worthy," and your recognition as a champion was a direct result of embracing and thriving in that competitive environment. This underscores the transformative power of competition in shaping character and fostering personal growth.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">27/11/23, 22:40 - Aditi Kapoor:  Munashe, you shall create the group and then reach out to people. And it's okay you shall try reaching out to other schools.</div></div>
