I want to target students from schools that pay above $100. However, I will not be discouraged I will try by all means to achieve this project</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">01/12/23, 13:28 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689:  Well, the Wednesday lesson was about the power of analyzing which is an art needed before undertaking any task. This skill is about developing a deeper understanding of the world around us. This skill includes understanding the task at hand, considering the inputs, crafting the process (developing a process or plan) , evaluating the output this allows you to identify areas of strength and weakness. It also includes learning from mistakes analyzing what went wrong. This helps refine your approach in the future. This skill is not only necessary in dealing with assignments and school work it is also useful in the professional world as employer's value individuals with this skill. That was my understanding of the Wednesday lesson</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/12/23, 13:40 - Unknown:  The Wednesday lesson response highlighted the crucial skill of analysis, emphasizing its role in understanding tasks, considering inputs, crafting processes, evaluating outputs, and learning from mistakes.

Keep honing these skills for success in various aspects of life.</div></div>

I managed to reach out to someone who's going to share with me the contact numbers of the students who are interested. He said he will get back to me once he is done. So for now I will be waiting for his response then I can create a WhatsApp group and add the students then share information about EDOOFA.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/12/23, 13:55 - Unknown:  That's excellent progress! Your proactive approach in reaching out and establishing contact for the community building project is commendable. Creating a WhatsApp group to share information about EDOOFA once you receive the contact numbers is a great initiative. Here are a few additional suggestions:</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/12/23, 14:27 - Mwaba EWYL23E0689:  Honestly my challenge is the issue of trying to reach out to students who are able to afford and those who have graduated from high school. The thing is most students I know who have recently graduated already know about the EDOOFA program. So the challenge here is reaching out to students who don't know about EDOOFA and are willing to be part of it . Remember when I told you I managed to reach out to someone who said he would share the contact numbers of the students who are interested, he said he will get back to me once he his done but I am still waiting up to now. I still have hope that he will manage</div></div>

I attended primary school from there but I left afterwards it continues up to secondary School there's also boarding for secondary</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/12/23, 14:48 - Unknown:  Thank you for sharing your challenges and efforts. To address reaching students unaware of EDOOFA:</div></div>
