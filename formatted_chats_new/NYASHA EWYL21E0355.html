<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 22:37 - NYASHA EWYL21E0355:  Yes Sir. Sometimes we want to blame people because of our failures. I would like to give an example of what l experienced in 2020 when l was in form 6 we did not go to school the whole year and some of us we thought that the government was going to postpone the dates of our examinations but no changes were made. We started to attend classes sometime in November and the exams started in December some of my classmates failed and they started to blame the government but not realising the teacher is only there to give us the course outline not to feed us with information some of my classmates didn't want to study on their own they started blaming the government for their mistakes.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 23:17 - Unknown:  Good to read your response on this lesson Edoofian! I am glad that you were able to understand the crux of that which is that successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about it, Nyasha1</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
