<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 19:12 - Unknown:  Today I wanted to discuss the recent message I shared with you. The message that we want to be our daily habit, our words of connecting and experiencing a sense of belonging, We all at team Edoofa are very thrilled as we personally are undertaking the same activity. May I know what have you understood from this message, what is the intention behind the same?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 20:21 - Natasha EWYL22E0356:  I have understand that  the Edoofa program and every other program in it serves to bring people who are part and parcel of it together trough working hard leaving us contented. It also serves to impower and equip the Edoofians to be determined and focused. 'I  am a proud Edoofian'is a statement that reminds every Edoofian of their aims.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 20:23 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 19:45 - Natasha EWYL22E0356:  A mind set defines each and every one of us. It is basically how we view everything around us, and it affects our lives in so many ways. Having the right mindset makes a difference between success and failure. Success in in almost every area of life can be influenced by how we think about  our talents and abilities. The most desired mindset for one one to be successful is the growth mindset. It is based on the idea that essential qualities are things we can cultivate through our efforts. Everyone can change and grow through experience and practice. The growth mindset of successful people allow them to   see failure not as a detriment but rather a springboard to success. To them, failing is actually learning. Knowing they are responsible for their growth, successful people tend to ask for and value feedback as they are interested in developing and challenging themselves. They are not afraid of criticism or judgment. A particular set of habits and an increased appetite for risk is the particular and profoundly powerful mindset that successful people have. Successful people tend to focus on growth, solving problems and self improvement. They believe that with efforts and perseverance they can excited and their intellect, broaden their skills, improve their character as well as overcome obstacles.</div></div>
