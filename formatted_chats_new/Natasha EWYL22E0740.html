I should set aside time for my sessions , time to study and time to practice.Coming up with a daily timetable and setting up reminders will also help me stick to my plans and maintain consistency.l have been facing challenges which have been preventing me to be consistent in my EWYL sessions. I wasn't able to balance my time wisely.l was consistent in my sporting schedules and ended up neglecting my sessions.l failed to balance my time and forgot l should give equal attention on my sporting career, studies and my sessions on EWYL discussions and projects</div></div>
