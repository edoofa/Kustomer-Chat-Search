I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/07/23, 18:41 - Nicole EWYL22E0025:  *A person who is happy is not happy because everything is right in his life, he is happy because his attitude towards everything in his life is right.* this is one of the most famous inspirational quotes of Sundar Pichai that l discovered.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">In addition to his focus on collaboration, innovation, and transparency, Pichai is also known for his commitment to diversity and inclusion.He has worked to create a workplace at Google that is inclusive and welcoming to people of all backgrounds and experiences.  Bill Gates had said - Unknown: If you are born poor, it's not your mistake but if you die poor, it is your mistake. Pichai's journey is proof of this - he did not let his background determine his future. He constantly encourages people to dream big, break boundaries and follow their passion. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai is too soft when it comes to leadership and handling people at all levels. He doesn't reportedly have a good hold on top-level people across company. A living legend that Puchai is,humility is one characteristic that never left his side.Easily approachable and soft spoken,he let's his work speak for himself,maintains a calm demeanor and strives to stay patient and live a drama free life.Despite his growing popularity,he believes in keeping a low profile.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/07/23, 18:47 - Tenzin:  I completely agree with you. Sundar Pichai's famous quote about happiness reflects his understanding of the importance of attitude in one's life. It emphasizes the power of having a positive mindset and approaching challenges with the right attitude.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">17/07/23, 16:23 - Nicole EWYL22E0025:  The most influential businessman of my country is Strive Masiyiwa. He grew up in a poor family in what was then Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and he faced a lot of discrimination and hardship in his life. He got his start in business by selling chickens and vegetables, and he used the profits to start other businesses. Eventually, he started Econet Wireless, which became a huge success. Masiyiwa has also been very generous with his wealth, and he's used it to support education, healthcare, and other causes.Strive Masiyiwa has had a huge impact on Zimbabwean society. Through his businesses and philanthropy, he's helped create jobs and opportunities for people. He's also been a champion of education, providing scholarships and building schools. He's helped improve healthcare by building clinics and supporting programs that train healthcare workers. And he's been an advocate for social justice, speaking out against corruption and working to improve human rights. He's also been a role model for many young people, showing them that they can achieve their dreams through hard work and perseverance.I think Strive Masiyiwa is inspiring for many reasons. First, his story of overcoming adversity and succeeding against the odds is very inspiring. He didn't have an easy start in life, and he's faced many challenges, but he never gave up and he always found a way to succeed. Second, his focus on giving back and helping others is inspiring. He's used his wealth and influence to make a difference in the world, and he's shown that it's possible to use business as a force for good. Third, he's a very humble and down-to-earth person, despite his wealth and success.</div></div>
