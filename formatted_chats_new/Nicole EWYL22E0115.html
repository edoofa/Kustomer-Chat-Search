<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/07/22, 20:41 - Nicole EWYL22E0115:  In my community the fastest growing industry is the food industry. Many new establishments are being set up daily that focus on buying and selling food items to people, from basic items such as drinks and sweets, to fast food and groceries that can be used daily. The rapid growth of the business could be as a result of the increase in demand of these items due to population growth. The main increase seems to be focused on fast food. People prefer it because it is very fast to prepare therefore sells at a faster rate, and also because customers prefer it since it is convenient. Many establishments are being set up from small stalls in the street,  to  restaurants all with the main goal of gaining profit from  this business. It is predicted that over the long run people will still benefit and make profits from this particular industry, because population numbers are continuing to rise, and therefore the demand for food will always be high. However due to the rise in competition between retailers, some businesses could suffer losses because customers may prefer the services being provided by competitors which could result in the decline of some of businesses.</div></div>
