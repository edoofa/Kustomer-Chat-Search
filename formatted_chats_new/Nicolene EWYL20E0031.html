<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 22:31 - Nicolene EWYL20E0031:  You were elaborating on what it means being a proud Edoofian</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 22:33 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
