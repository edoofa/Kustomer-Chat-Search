<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 01:34 - Unknown:  Hello nigel! How are you doing my proud Edoofian?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 01:34 - Unknown:  nigel,Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 01:34 - Unknown:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 01:34 - Unknown:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>

The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/11/22, 01:04 - Unknown:  What?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">17/11/22, 01:05 - Nigel EWYL22E0312:  l mean its alright</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">17/11/22, 01:15 - Unknown:  Great! Although, on the point that you are being served only eggs. I would like to emphasize by saying that it is really lucky for you to be able to get even eggs in the university mess. As you know, India is a Hindu country, and in its traditions and culture. Non-veg is strictly prohibited. In some homes, you cannot even bring it inside a house. In a similar way, since Indians consider schools and colleges as a place of worship, it is the temple of education. Hence, it is strictly prohibited to run any non-veg kitchen on the campuses. But even then universities are trying to provide it to you. Secondly, meat or protein is something which you can have an alternative for, or order it from outside or eat it from some different place. So, I guess it shall be a majority call, and since most of the students are vegetarians, they even tend to stay away from eating from any kitchen where non-veg is prepared. So, I don't think it would be possible for the university to make that call. Apart from that, regarding the hygiene issues, you would be notified of the call to action tomorrow and can follow it.</div></div>
