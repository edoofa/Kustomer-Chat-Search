To always work hard snd give it your best in all that you do. This ai got from the part in the story where it is said that he got his bosses, in predominantly run by white south Africans firm to develop a unique interest in him. I learnt also the lesson of allowing ourselves to be involved in our domestic businesses in our houses because we may learn quite a lot from it that will greatly aid us in our future business endeavors just as Pratice'[ involvement in his home \"Spaza\" at homs made him to learn a bit about the mining business. I also got the lesson of to always have persistence nand perseverance because in the end it all pays out greatly just as it happened with Pratice who continued with diligence and hard work through out all  his years and always strived for growth and excellence.</div></div>
