May I know why?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 02:31 - Nyasha EWYL21E0099:  I accidentally cleared up this group's chat including a few more chats.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 21:09 - Unknown:  *WEDNESDAY LESSON  we have another dose of Wednesday wisdom on our most loved topic of Entrepreneurship. Yes, today’s lesson is going to talk about a sincere and passionate young female entrepreneur who has made her mark on the African Start up ecosystem. She is an award-winning UI\/UX Designer with seven years of experience working in the technology environment. We are talking about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the founder of Skooqs. Today’s lesson will take us through the incident when Skooqs was born. I am sure a very valuable lesson is there for all of us to learn from. \u2028\u2028Also, I would like to highlight that Skooqs has partnered with Edoofa and will be working closely on providing our students with projects to work on and gain experience.  The first batch is already assigned the project. \u2028\u2028Go through the audio and pdf carefully and let me know if you have any concerns.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
