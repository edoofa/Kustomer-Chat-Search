<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 23:29 - Panashe EWYL21E0013:  To be honest l felt heartbroken and also l was angry at myself. Honestly why didn't l attend the function ,that is exactly the question l asked myself when l watched the video.My fellow friends looked so happy and l believe they learnt a lot of things that day and obviously they are now more experienced than me.Most of the videos l watch on internet about the Edoofa Scholarship Program it's very rare for me to find a video that doesn't mention the names Mr Angad Singh and Mr Avreen and it has been my wish eversince l was told  they are the founders of Edoofa to meet them in person and l missed the chance..To be honest l can't show it on this platform but it's really painful.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 00:25 - Unknown:  I absolutely understand your emotion Panashe.

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us.
