I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">01/08/22, 18:52 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/08/22, 19:34 - Unknown:  Panashe the SKOOQS project was something that required immediate attention as well as a quick response but I feel you are having severe connectivity issues and later you went to your rural place too. Don't worry Panashe that's completely all right. I understand there are many such situations and I could completely relate to the difficulty that you might be facing. For now, I want you to focus on the EWYL sessions that you have where we discuss our Wednesday lesson, weekend activity, newsletter, and our ongoing three projects. I know you are a very bright kid and I have so many upcoming projects in the coming weeks. Till then put all your focus on your ongoing EWYL sessions that are held on the EWYL LINE every MONDAY AND THURSDAY.</div></div>

He has comprehensive experience in areas such as interactive print, packaging, copywriting, and design. He says the one thing he wishes he had known sooner was, ‘that sometimes when an idea is still at birth, not many will see it the way you do but you have to believe in it yourself. He also highlights that the best business decision you can ever make is hiring the right people.</div></div>
