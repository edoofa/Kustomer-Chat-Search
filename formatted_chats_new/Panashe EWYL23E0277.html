<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/07/23, 12:39 - Panashe EWYL23E0277:  On the 16th of January 1974 a legend was born, today I live calling him as my father and to tell the truth I am proud to be called his son. Since I can remember he has always and will still always be my inspiration. Back at his early‚Äôs he lived in a rural area called Madziva in Zimbabwe, he lived in a family of nine. My father did his primary and secondary level and he had to walk nearly 14 kilometers to and from school, and after school they would have to go with their herd  in the bushes for them to graze but what inspired me the most is his capability to thrive through with his education though they had a poor education system and them having to walk without shoes to school on daily basis at times they would go without food to eat during their breakfast and lunch but with all those difficulties he managed to pass his examinations though he failed many times he still kept on trying he did it and got a job and with that job we are earning a living. Besides the ups and downs he had he kept on thriving to what I can say is his potential. Despite all the challenges he face up to now he conquers them and he is able to cater the three of us our rights for education that is why I am inspired to take over the button as I am the first son in the family it is now in my hands to learn and work hard that I am able to lift my family since he is now old and about to retire.He has been my inspiration fo as long as I can remember.</div></div>
