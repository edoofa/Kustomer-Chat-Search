I am sure you will agree to the fact that Attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 23:03 - Pardon EWYL22E0112:  Yes  unsuccessful people will always find a thing to blame not checking where they cld hv gone wrong</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 18:19 - Unknown:  My key takeaway points are that we should not scapegoat our failures but beginning take responsibility for all the shortcomings we encounter in our day to day living. If negligence is prolonged it might as well turn out to an individual feeling the impossibility to succeed thus, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy that failure is unavoidable anyway. Whilst on the other hand, successful people accept failure for what it is and learn from their mistakes and do something about it. They understand that there is no shortcut to success and one can work hard with little to no achievement sometimes and this could be payback time for all the time spent in neglect. But,  however this should not deter  one from working hard and diligently</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
