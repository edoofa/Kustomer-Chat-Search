<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/05/23, 15:55 - Patience EWYL22E0053:  I got to understand   the kind  leadership style that is serving leadership  whereby we serve   the people and the characteristics of a servant leader  and that servant leaders  use persuasion  than authority   to encourage people to take action</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">19/05/23, 17:11 - Ananya:  Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.</div></div>
