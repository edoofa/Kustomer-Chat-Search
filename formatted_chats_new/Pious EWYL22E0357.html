Not everyone wants your success and don’t listen to the negative thoughts of people, always stay focused and positive. People may blame you for doing the right things but you should also keep on pushing, you should be in a position to be able to choose the best people who can motivate you to achieve the best. Nothing is for free everything comes after sweat and many more lessons, I have learned a lot today sir thank you very much.</div></div>
