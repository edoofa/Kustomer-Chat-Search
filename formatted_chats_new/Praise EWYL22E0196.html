I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">09/08/22, 23:06 - Unknown:  Today, if you go to New York, you will find hundreds of places where they learn chanting. People go for one hour in the evenings to chanting classes. They chant ‘Om Namah Shivaya’, which is originally an Indian Chant’. Of course, they have a different pronunciation.In China, they say, ‘Ladhe Ladhe’ .</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/08/22, 22:16 - Unknown:  Chanting brings us many medical, psychological and social benefits. In initial stages of chanting it may be difficult to recognise the benefits we derive from chanting. In later stages too, knowing the benefits of chanting can restore our faith after we have experienced them.</div></div>
