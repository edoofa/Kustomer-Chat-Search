The second idea l learnt is that  l have to stop fixation on failure , this idea shows that there is nothing called failure in life as it said the many times you fail is the much time you have life lessons  which led to my mind getting organized and being an organized person  and the last mantra l learnt is that l should find my inspiration on things l will be doing.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/08/22, 08:15 - Praise EWYL22E0434:  The success mantra that suits my personality and that l have already mastered as part of this week assignment is that giving up is not an option , by this l learnt that for one to be successful he or she has to not give up so easily in life . This encourage  me to work hard in everything even though there is an element of failure. One has to try , and try again to become successful in life .The other idea that suits my personality is that to say never fall asleep on journey whilst not yet reaching  your destination . This motivated me to work extra hard until l succeed in life . The other mantra that suits me is to do less competition rather than working on achieving my goals .</div></div>
