<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">20/04/23, 15:09 - Praise EWYL22E1028:  The main cause of environmental problems in my community are people who are polluting the land and cutting down trees which leads to  deforestation and eventually causes land degradation. Those industries that realise toxic chemicals in water and those that destroy trees for infrastructure development end up killing animals and destroying their habitat. The government should heavily fine those that pollute the land and also encourage citizens to have a clean up campaign.</div></div>
