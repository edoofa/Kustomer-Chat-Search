<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/05/23, 18:53 - Aditi Kapoor:  It's great to hear that you learned about the importance of persistence and willpower in achieving your goals. Fear can be a major obstacle to success, but by controlling your mind and trusting yourself, you can overcome it. Accumulating power is also an important aspect of achieving your goals, and the three ways you mentioned - accumulated experience, infinite intelligence, and experience and research - are all valuable ways to do so. Remember, with the right mindset and a commitment to personal growth, anything is possible.</div></div>
