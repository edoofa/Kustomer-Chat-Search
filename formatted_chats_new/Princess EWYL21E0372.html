<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 18:20 - Princess EWYL21E0372:  Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe is a well known business man here in Africa. He got his first exposure to the business world and understood the mining business. He acquired this knowledge while helping his father sell liquor to mine workers. Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe studied and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Swaziland, then subsequently earned a law degree from the University of the Witwatersrand. After getting his LLB, in 1988, Patrice Motsepe got a great job offer from the Bowman Gilfillan law firm, which was one of South Africa’s most reputable law firms. His drive, commitment to growth, and high success rates in his job activities got his bosses to take a unique interest in him. He later met several mining organizations and studying their operations sprouted a zeal and attraction in him for the business. This exposure caused Patrice Motsepe to start studying the mining business in every way that he could. Patrice Motsepe promptly founded the African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) and proceeded to acquire one of the mine shafts that were up for sale by AngloGold. Today, his company has strategic partnerships and mergers with other mining organizations and has added a wide list of minerals to its coffers like nickel, chrome, coal, iron, manganese and precious metals (platinum and its related products). In the process, Patrice Motsepe has built one of the largest mining companies in the world. Patrice Motsepe is a good example of determination and success.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">07/10/22, 18:13 - Princess EWYL21E0372:  In this week's Wednesday lesson, I learnt the tips to time management. I learnt that I should have a vision on how to utilise my time efficiently. I have to find my productive cycle so that i perform well. This is the time when I'll be having the most energy to use my time well and execute the tasks well. I should also create a master list so that i know how my day will be laid out.</div></div>
