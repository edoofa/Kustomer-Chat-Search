<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">24/12/23, 22:44 - Prosper EWYL23E0696:  In Zimbabwe, for many people, Christmas day starts with a special church service, and the children, dressed in their best clothes, sing the songs that they have practised for this special day. After church, the whole family gather together to start a celebration and feast. Traditional Christmas food in Zimbabwe Chicken, while quite pricey these days, is especially savoured during Christmas in Zimbabwe. Naturally, there are a number of ways to enjoy chicken, but it is often the stew, curry, and oven-roast recipes that take the cake.As for me, I recommend family Christmas traditions so strongly because family traditions bond us closer together; they help  kids feel a sense of belonging; they create memories that will last a lifetime; they give us something to look forward to and they can help shape the character of everyone, especially the children.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">02/01/24, 14:47 - Prosper EWYL23E0696:  As for me ,  last year had so much  to learn .From when it started , when l wrote the first term exams l did very well in two of my subjects and only got a point in Mathematics. This wasn't because I didn't practice well but because l made a lot of mistakes which reduced the my mark.After we were given the papers for that test , l went to see the Maths teacher .All l wanted was to be given a solution on what l have to do to minimize those silly mistakes.Since the teacher realized my effort, instead of telling me that I did it wrong , he told me that l was very close to the right answers and that l must keep on trying, .I then realized that l have to learn from that mistake. When we wrote the mid year exams , l also failed Maths exam but l had little mistakes on my working .All l knew was that l had to trust the process so that when all mistakes are dealt with , it will be definitely not probably.I  had to first find out the problem , which were the mistakes l made , so that l will do something to correct it and all will be fine.When the final Maths exam came , l knew that l have to go through all my work so that mistakes are minimized and that l did.Same thing applies in our lives , when we fail in what we do ,it's not because we can't do that thing , it's only that we have to find out the problem so that it   won't reduce our performance and always trust the process .</div></div>
