The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organisation wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. With the quality of education provided to the student completing high school, edoofa would want to transform your school’s every student into a person who’s so strong in the knowledge that he/she becomes better than his/her peers. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth.)</div></div>
