Moving on one has to be resilient and hard working   because in everything that we do as individuals requires us to be hard working and resilient (the ability to face any challenges without braking or giving up) because in the line of work  we face different challenges whichever may force us to throw in the towel but an edoofian needs to be resilient so that he can produce good results. Adding on one must be   punctual  that's being able to meet certain deadlines that will be  set  aside for different projects because failure to meet the deadline might cost you or the company  hence the reason why punctuality is ever emphasised in all line of work.  Moreover  an edoofian must  be a risk taker, willing to do certain things even if he or she is not sure about  whether it will yield something positive or not  because how will you know if you have made the right decision or not without taking a risk  and even if it doesn't yield a good result at least you would have learned something new  from that.  Furthermore one must be able to work with electrical gadgets as well as having good research skills, when we are talking about research skills we are talking about the ability to research what is tranding in the market ,what is being produced in small quantities so that the needs of people might  be met.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 17:36 - Rachel EWYL21E0808:  The story of Patrice motsepe is something that is so  facinating and what so facinating about  his story is that he didn't allow his background to stop him from achieving what he wants instead he says it  molded him into being what he is today as  he was introduced to business by his father through selling liquor to miners. Moving on   the fact that he is a risk taker  is something that I can  applaud him for because he bought a gold company  and that company was not producing more but he took the risk of buying it even if he didn't know whether it was going to bring him profit or not , but from that risk he paved his way into the mining sector . Therefore  from his ability to be a risk taker l learnt that for one to be successful one must be willing to take risks.  In addition  l was also facinated by the fact that he didn't only focus on mining  but he exposed himself  to many different types of businesses  as a result he has shares from other companies as well</div></div>

Don't play the  blame game if you want to be successful</div></div>
