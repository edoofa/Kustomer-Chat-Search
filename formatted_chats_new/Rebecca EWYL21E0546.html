<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 21:32 - Unknown:  It's that time of the week when you are required to wear your thinking caps and get your tools ready to research and learn! From our Wednesday Wisdom, we learned how Patrice Motsepe, became successful by making the best of the opportunity very few could see, the strong potential in the mining industry. As part of your Saturday Activity, you are required to share a detailed submission on the fast-growing industry\/sector\/business in your country. Don’t forget to add a SWOT analysis and predictions on the future performance of the same.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
