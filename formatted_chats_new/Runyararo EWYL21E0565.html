I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">31/07/22, 21:33 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of. \r</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">08/08/22, 22:51 - Runyararo EWYL21E0565:  As for the Wednesday wisdom,  I learned that Eugene Peters was so determined since his childhood. He got exposed to computers at the age of 15 that's when he started building  his passion towards computers.  He worked hard until he achieved his dream.Eugene Gilbert was focused and had a positive mindset.</div></div>
