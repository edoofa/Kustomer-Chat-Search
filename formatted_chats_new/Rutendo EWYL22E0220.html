<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 04:04 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220:  In Zimbabwe there are natural resources which become goods and raw materials and these increase economic development and industrial growth. For the natural resources to be used the government made policies towards the use of raw materials and it is trying to have a stable currency which is needed for capital. Labor supply in Zimbabwe is high but there are less jobs or employment available for the citizens. Technology is improving since Zimbabwe gained its independence and the President of Zimbabweade a plan called the 2030 vision which sees the country developed and economically stable. Technology is making jobs easier, faster and better which is leading to an increase in a business's output and an increase in profits. Infrastructure is being improved especially the roads which are under renovations for the industry sector to have better transportation. Trucks with refrigerators are being used to transport perishables from the industries to the markets or being exported. Introduction of Rural growth points in Zimbabwe has made some industries to relocate and create markets for other industries too and the informal sector is slowly improving the industrial sector. The main industries in Zimbabwe are mining, farming, sugarcane, tea, tobacco and cotton production. This is improving day by day but there are always challenges which are economic and political which can affect the industry sector. Zimbabwe's government is trying to develop a a stable currency but its failing and this is affecting industrial development. I can predict that if the currency doesn't get stable within the next 7 to 10 years Zimbabwe's economy will have fallen drastically.</div></div>

Clean my room as always and then greet everyone in the house. I will go out for a walk exploring my neighborhood. I then come back and bath and also read my  books for 2 hours, after that I go out to meet with my friends and as a teenager we move around doing mostly what makes us happy and at lunch we mostly go to our house and have lunch. After lunch we talk about our lives and how we can improve it mostly in the park. At around 3pm we go to the soccer academy and play there. I'm the vice captain and it really makes me feel happy and boosts my confidence around people. After playing soccer, we then escort each other home and then I have a bath and eat and then go to sleep</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">23/07/22, 21:09 - Rutendo EWYL22E0220:  People with great and successful mindsets do not have a  fixed mindset but have an abundance mentality. They don't fear failure and are always motivating themselves to keep pushing and never give up even if they fail,to keep pushing through  the pain.\"No pain no gain\" everything needs focus and also to be responsible for what ever that happens. Create a long term vision instead of only creating short term goals. Learn to listen to your gut and keep believing that you can do it even if the odds are not on your side. For me to be successful and have a great mindset I will develop a simple morning routine that I will follow to improve my discipline and I will always remind myself of my successes whenever I fail so that I can have hope and aspirations. I will try to put myself in new challenging situations and always think of failure as a learning opportunity and as my mentor. I will always be persistent and just never give up on whatever I do even if it's in academics I will try my best and prove to everyone especially my edoofa family that I can do everything through christ who strengthens me.</div></div>
