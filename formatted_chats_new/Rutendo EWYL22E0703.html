<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/05/23, 16:42 - Unknown:  Today we're going to talk about how to find student-centric SMEs in Africa using Google and LinkedIn. Are you familiar with these tools?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/05/23, 16:51 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703:  Yes I am....</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/05/23, 17:30 - Unknown:  SMEs stands for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. These are businesses that typically have fewer employees, less revenue, and a smaller market share than larger corporations. The exact definition of an SME can vary depending on the country or region, but generally, it refers to businesses that have fewer than 250 employees and annual revenue of less than a certain amount.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/05/23, 17:39 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703:  Okay I'm following</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/05/23, 17:44 - Unknown:  we'll go through it step by step. Let's start with Google. When you're searching for student-centric SMEs in Africa, what keywords do you think you should use?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/05/23, 17:49 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703:  Small scale online businesses in Africa</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/05/23, 17:53 - Unknown:  That's a good start. You could also try "student-centered SMEs in Africa" or "African startups focused on education". Once you have a list of relevant startups, the next step is to find the company officials on LinkedIn. Have you used LinkedIn before?</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 15:42 - Rutendo EWYL22E0703:  Networking is very important in our day to day lives. It helps in many fields such as marketing, advertising and publicity. The same goes for the student community at Edoofa. Major initiatives have been taken to contact various school heads to spread the word out here. I have personally made an effort to tell my friends about how lucky I am to be a part of the Edoofa community. A lot of Zimbabweans might think it's a scam  because opportunities like these are not open most of the times. The Edoofa team has put an effort by creating testimonial videos for everyone and uploading them on social media platforms like Instagram. But again, due to our rusty economy , a few can only afford to access the internet. Another better way would be reaching out to national television broadcasting companies and make a scheduled interview alongside with the minister of education so that people would really really believe that it's not a scam. Some have heard the word but they choose let the opportunity pass but the sad truth is most of the times we let life changing opportunities pass because of what we hear.</div></div>
