<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">18/05/23, 17:21 - Ananya:  Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 16:02 - Ananya:  That is wonderful, so would you like to share your thoughts on it?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 16:07 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086:  I have learnt that one must be self aware of his or herself,you must know what you are made of and what you are capable of,hence for you to be productive,and from the Life of Barack Obama l have learnt how introversion and how timr management had led to his success.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 16:07 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086:  For me to be productive on daily basis l have got a list of strengths and characteristic traits which helps me through the day, these include the following; l am adaptive to the environment l will be working on, l am flexible to new changes and l am optimistic, l am cooperative l found it easy to work with others,l am punctual and self motivated,l have laser-like focus,and l tend to arm myself with the right tools needed at that specific time, l protect my priorities, l am conscious of what l want to achieve in my life hence this gives me a better productivity when l am home ,so when ever l found time l sit with my self and medidate on how l am going to achieve my personal goals, l am open, l am more willing to listen to multiple viewpoints and always try to do new things, l am observant and submissively attentive to any rules that l should operate within, l am savvy ,l am a risk- taker,l am energetic ,creative and highly organised, l am also passionate about my life , ambitious and driven, l know what is important and plan my day ,l prioritise my daily routines, whenever l am left behind l am able to get back on track faster, and l am a problem solver.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 16:08 - Ananya:  I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 16:10 - Rutendo EWYL22E1086:  And l mostly noted that,If Obama who had so much on his plate almost every day,</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 16:27 - Ananya:  You do not have to contact them, our team will contact them and then you will earn the credits. It is easier for you to just search for the company and building resources for the team.</div></div>
