For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard.</div></div>

It showed that you need a lot of hard work and dedication. You have to believe and have faith that you can do. You can start by something small that'll contribute to your journey of success. You have to choose friends or patners carefully as being with the wrong person can have a big impact in your business or future.  It encouraged to strive for the best and to take risks</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 15:28 - Ruth EWYL22E0122:  Understood</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 15:37 - Saloni Rastogi:  Greetings of the day Ruth!</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 15:38 - Saloni Rastogi:  Ruth I saw you have typed 3 which means you don't know what makes you a proud edoofian.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 15:39 - Saloni Rastogi:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- *“I am a proud Edoofian”*</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 15:39 - Saloni Rastogi:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 20:52 - Saloni Rastogi:  I read your response to your weekend activity and it made me so inquisitive to know about the mining industry I got to know that predominant minerals mined by the industry include platinum, chrome, gold, coal, and diamonds. The country boasts the second-largest platinum deposit and high-grade chromium ores in the world, with approximately 2.8 billion tons of platinum group metals and 10 billion tons of chromium ore.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 20:54 - Saloni Rastogi:  The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">24/07/22, 19:15 - Ruth EWYL22E0122:  It was about the SWOT analysis. The swot analysis is important in a business because it shows the progress of the business and highlights where it's lagging. A personal SWOT analysis helps you to go back to the drawing board and work on yourself.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:18 - Saloni Rastogi:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
