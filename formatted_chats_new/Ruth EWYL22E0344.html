<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 21:46 - Unknown:  I read your response Ruth and it made me so inquisitive to know about the cosmetic industry in Zimbabwe and look what I found  you look out there, here in Zimbabwe, you will notice an interesting trend. So many people are now vendors who specifically focus on just cosmetic products. The other day someone approached me selling body sprays and deodorants. What struck me was that most of their products were priced at just one US dollar. What also struck me is selling cosmetic products is their full-time hustle. The difference here is that they move around on foot selling their stuff. No wonder why starting a cosmetics shop business is bound to be profitable given how many people are surviving on elementary vending of cosmetic products.''</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/22, 21:49 - Unknown:  The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

It's good to be social media literate since this comes back to one as a benefit. In what ever way you do one should never forget his\/ her community and should work in a position to upgrade it.</div></div>

How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.</div></div>
