<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 16:43 - Ruvarashe EWYL21E0332:  What I learned from the Wednesday lesson was that, A son grew up helping his father who started as a teacher and later on owned a shop (Patrice) and he didn't start at top but he started small. There's a trend of successful people which is the sense of never giving up. Patrice advanced his education and his first degree of Arts he got it from the University of Swaziland then later on went for Law and attained education and got LLB. He then went to work for Bowman's Law firm in South Africa. Patrice got so successful because his drive, commitment to growth, and high success work rates got his bosses take a unique interest in him.Patrice staring up mining and law business was indeed a great turning point in his life, it changed him for the better.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 05:05 - Unknown:  The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">11/10/22, 15:42 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
