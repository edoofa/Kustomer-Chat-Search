<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">20/11/23, 14:13 - Ruvimbo EWYL23E0875:  When my form four results came out  I had performed well and I was looking forward to do my A level in boarding school where I was before  but at that moment things were very tough and hard at home. We had a financial crisis There was no option left for me than to just learn at a local school. To be honest I was so hurt because  changing the environment  walking a distance to go to school it was all new. But I want to thank God that I quickly  accepted the situation and I took advantage of it  that I created time for extra lessons after school. To be honest I didn't let all that affect me and to be honest  I really did learn a lot and my circle of friends extended and I also got time to  spend with my family. It was also a great opportunity because my peers from my local school are the ones who introduced me to this program Edoofa.The school I was completing my A level at made me more determined  because I got this desire to improve a lot on my schools. My wish is to sponser it and increase a lot of buildings there which is what keeps me going till today.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/11/23, 14:14 - Aditi Kapoor:  Ruvimbo, your resilience and positive attitude in the face of challenges are truly admirable. It must have been a significant adjustment to switch to a local school due to financial constraints after performing well in your form four exams. Your acceptance of the situation and your proactive decision to make the best of it by engaging in extra lessons and expanding your circle of friends demonstrate a remarkable mindset.</div></div>
