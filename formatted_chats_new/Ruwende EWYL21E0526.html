<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 22:43 - Unknown:  Ruwende let me resend you the Wednesday lesson once again.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 22:43 - Unknown:  Here we have another dose of Wednesday wisdom on our most loved topic of Entrepreneurship. Yes, today’s lesson is going to talk about a sincere and passionate young female entrepreneur who has made her mark on the African Start up ecosystem. She is an award-winning UI\/UX Designer with seven years of experience working in the technology environment. We are talking about Oluwadamilola Soyombo, the founder of Skooqs. Today’s lesson will take us through the incident when Skooqs was born. I am sure a very valuable lesson is there for all of us to learn from. \u2028\u2028Also, I would like to highlight that Skooqs has partnered with Edoofa and will be working closely on providing our students with projects to work on and gain experience.  The first batch is already assigned the project. \u2028\u2028Go through the audio and pdf carefully and let me know if you have any concerns.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 19:05 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526:  One learning l have learnt from the inspiring story  is that one can move from just being an idea , to having product live,  with courses , instructors and schools . I have also leant that for one to be successful there is need for advisers , friends  (team work ) and also prayers</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 23:11 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 00:09 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526:  In our Wednesday lesson l have learnt that we shouldn't  blame our resources or people around us when we fail to achieve what we want inlife . I have  also learnt that things don't happen magically when one wants to be successful  he or she has to work extra hard</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:29 - Unknown:  Greetings of the day Ruwende!</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:30 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526:  Going very well thanks</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:30 - Unknown:  I read your response Ruwende and I would love to share an article on successful people with you :</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:31 - Unknown:  So in today's session, we will:</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:47 - Ruwende EWYL21E0526:  Ooh okay</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 17:17 - Unknown:  Good morning Ruwende!</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 17:18 - Unknown:  Since you have typed 2 and you are willing to know what a proud edoofian is and what it denotes, I would love to enlighten you with knowledge on the same.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 17:19 - Unknown:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 17:19 - Unknown:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 17:21 - Unknown:  Let me know if you now you are aware of who a proud edoofian is and what is the importance of following this ritual daily.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 17:22 - Unknown:  As we move on after you acknowledge, we will be left with our discussion on:</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:16 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
