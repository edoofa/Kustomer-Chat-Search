<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/02/23, 03:11 - SIDNEY EWYL22E0598:  This is about a situation where l had to start a club at our school. The club was about environmental care. l was only in form 2 and l had to go talk to the senior lady at the school to let her know of my idea and if she was to approve l then had to go and present it to the headmaster for the final endorsement. I had never spoken to anyone in a higher authority and l was very scared but l gathered up enough confidence to speak to the senior lady and l had to do more research to make a killer presentation to the headmaster. My headmaster to me at that point he was very intimidating and he asked me a lot of questions but l was able to sail through.What l had not known was that l have to now go class by class telling the students about the club so that they can join. I had to persuade the students l can say this is when l acquired good communication skills. Some of them looked down upon me and l learnt to be bolder than l was the other students admired my boldness and that made me more confident.</div></div>
