<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/07/22, 07:19 - Saint EWYL21E0693:  In my research i have noticed that most successful upcoming business now are on agriculture sector. For example Zimbabwe is one of the countries in the world with richest soil, plenty of land and favorable climate conditions  good for farming. Indeed it is expensive especially when starting but one can enjoy profits easily. Especially growing legumes like ground nuts, beans and other crops like wheat. The market of such crops is readily available in the world but sometimes affected by Chain of demand. Apart from that for such organization to be successful it requires to be done in large scale thus requires more labor and capital intensive hence more expensive to startup. In this sector it is easy to acquire loans and financial help as government is ready to help such organization. It also  requires expertise in such industry to manage and come up with good harvest which are very few and expensive to hire. Due to rapid climate change in the world  such industry will be affected for example cyclones. Especially in Zimbabwe the government is giving free education on farming and also supplying inputs to such organisation's for free thus reducing expenses of business.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 15:39 - Saint EWYL21E0693:  As you told me earlier that, positive mindset, confidence and critical thinking is the route to success. Most successful people they have hope and patience in their mind, because it takes very  long for someone to be successful and also it takes ups and downs (hardships) for us to be successful. Successful one's keep on going nomatter how many times the fall whilst failure can not endure pain they just let it go. As for me I will make sure that I utilize this opportunity by having guidance from you my mentors and your teachings, as most successful people are good listeners. Through sharing some ideas that can guide and sharpen my brain I will be successful one day. For us to be successful one should learn  to accept and to be responsible other than play blame game. Most successful people have bright mind as they find problems in the community and try the best way to solve the problem thus being helpful. The other thing is if you want to be successful don't rush take step by step and also you should find field that you are comfortable in not doing something that won't makes you feel home.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 15:50 - Saint EWYL21E0693:  Q1. Through doing projects and task from my mentors.

Apart from that, your companionship will decide your future so the most important take away is making wise choose when choosing your friends. Lastly, financial planning is of paramount importance if you want to go further, because every dollar count</div></div>
