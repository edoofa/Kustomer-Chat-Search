<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/10/23, 03:18 - Salome EWYL23E0719:  Good evening,my apologies for submitting this assignment late.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/10/23, 03:20 - Salome EWYL23E0719:  I was not feeling well but luckily l found time to research and wish to share a story l once read about.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/10/23, 03:22 - Salome EWYL23E0719:  I would like to talk about Jane Eyre is the main character in Charlotte BrontÃ«'s novel of the same name. I once did literature in my advanced level and we did this novel and l loved it. She is a young woman who has faced many hardships in her life, including poverty, abuse, and the death of her loved ones.       Despite these challenges, she remains strong, determined, and resilient.       She is an inspiring character because of her strength, intelligence, and courage.                  Jane is an orphan who is raised by her cruel and abusive aunt.       She eventually leaves her aunt's home and becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets Mr. Rochester, the owner of the estate.       Jane and Mr. Rochester fall in love, but it turns out that Mr. Rochester is already married to a woman who is insane and locked away in a room in his house.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/10/23, 03:25 - Salome EWYL23E0719:  Mr. Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but she refuses because she doesn't want to be a part of a bigamous marriage.       She leaves Thornfield Hall and eventually becomes a teacher at a girls' school.       Mr. Rochester's wife sets Thornfield Hall on fire and dies in the flames.       After this, Jane returns to Thornfield Hall and finds Mr. Rochester blind and crippled from the fire.                       So Jane decides to stay with Mr. Rochester and care for him.       Even though he is disabled and has lost everything, she still loves him and they eventually get married.    It's a really beautiful story about love and forgiveness, and it's also a story about perseverance in the face of hardship.       Jane Eyre is a really inspiring character and a great example of someone who never gives up.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/10/23, 03:27 - Salome EWYL23E0719:  I think Jane is a great example of someone who is strong, brave, and compassionate.       She's someone who shows that it's possible to overcome adversity and still be a good person.      Her story is relevant today.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/10/23, 03:27 - Salome EWYL23E0719:  In conclusion l can say  Jane's story is a great reminder that even one person can make a difference.       She shows that it's possible to overcome adversity and find happiness, even when the odds are stacked against you. I think her story could encourage people to be strong, compassionate, and resilient, no matter what life throws at them.  I could say Jane is a feminist icon.</div></div>
