After reading the Wednesday lesson  l realised and learnt that Social media player a pivotal role in people' s lives . Taking from where Wode Maya began  and where he is today . Truly , Social media is a powerful factor in transforming people's life stories. I have also learnt that one can achieve their dreams when they get a supporting factor for example in this case, Wode Maya got support from his mother though his father did not support him.</div></div>
