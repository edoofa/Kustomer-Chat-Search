I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/01/23, 18:01 - Sandra EWYL21E0798:  I have learned about the principles to persuasion which  are scarcity ,reciprocity,authority,commitment, liking and consensus.l have realised that l can use these in my EWYL projects. Firstly reciprocity means actually convincing someone by making them feel a sense of settling  social obligations and this can be archieved by acting first doing something great to a person he or she will want to return the favour. Secondl scarcityis increasing the desire for what you offer by making it scarce. This will increase the desire of people for your product or services but keeping in mind that using this method repeatedly will seem like inefficient to your clients especially when you dont have enough power.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/01/23, 18:08 - Sandra EWYL21E0798:  Furthermore authority is also another principle and it makes a person more influential and persuasive by taking authority of what they do. It builds trust and people tend to follow those they trust. L will also use this principle in my projects. Building trust will make me be able to convince my fellow students to take the Edoofa scolarship program.ln addition to that there is commitment and consistency and this is when people like to be consistent with their identity or sense of self image. Also liking is another principle where people tend to follow or influenced by those they like. If l become likeable by my fellow peers l can get them to follow me. Lastly consensus which means humans are social by nature and they tend to follow the norms of a aocial group and this can be archieved by managing your reputation</div></div>
