For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">23/07/22, 00:30 - Sandra EWYL22E0114:  What I understood from the Wednesday wisdom is that most of the time when things are not going well, people tend to look around to find something they can put the blame on. It is quite rare for people to inspect and accept their own flaws which then leads to failures. People should accept their mistakes and learn from them if they want to be better and successful</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/07/22, 19:49 - Sandra EWYL22E0114:  Wednesday Wisdom was about time management. I learned that the way I manage my time depends on how I manage my priorities. There are urgent and important activities which may all need to be done, but with good time management skills I can get everything done at the appropriate time because I would have understood how to prioritise my activities. Some things may be urgent but not important and some important but not urgent while some are both. According to my understanding, it will be best to start off with urgent and important things</div></div>
