Taking Mr Shantaram Siddi as an example when he was a kid his hunger of knowledge made him get recognised and it never stopped there he also realised that only a few people get an opportunity that he got and he made a promise to himself that he has to help the community get the recognition that they deserve. More so l should discuss the challenges and roadblocks am facing with my mentor and find solutions to them in order to do well and make me and my community proud</div></div>
