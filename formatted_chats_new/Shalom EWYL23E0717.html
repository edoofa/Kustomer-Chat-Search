<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">26/12/23, 16:48 - Shalom EWYL23E0717:  Christmas is a very important holiday in Zimbabwe, and many families have their own special traditions. For example, many families will attend church services on Christmas Eve, and then return home to enjoy a festive meal. The main course is usually a roasted chicken or goat, and it's usually accompanied by sadza (a thick porridge made from cornmeal) and vegetables. Families often exchange gifts, and children may receive toys and other special treats. Many families also like to decorate their homes with colorful lights and festive decorations.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">26/12/23, 16:50 - Shalom EWYL23E0717:  One of the most unique traditions of celebrating Christmas in Zimbabwe is the concept of "kuganha." This is a tradition where family and friends gather together to share food, drink, and conversation. The idea is to create a sense of community and connection, and to build relationships with the people in your life. Kuganha often takes place in the evening on Christmas Eve, and it usually lasts for several hours. There's usually a lot of laughter and storytelling involved!</div></div>
