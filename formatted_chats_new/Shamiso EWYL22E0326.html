<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">28/07/22, 18:21 - Unknown:  Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times pere week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/08/22, 13:04 - Shamiso EWYL22E0326:  The first secret to Mr Peters' success is hard work. He was never idle. He was constantly looking for something to do for his betterment.  Gilbert Eugiene believed in his goal. He had no room for doubts. He also accepted help from others meaning he had no big ego and he was not a lone ranger. Another secret of his success is prayer. He always aligned himself with God and that is why he never went wrong. His accolades are very inspiring given his age. It will be unjust if I do not mention about his commitment towards his work. Sky is never the limit when you are committed. I believe if I am committed,prayerfull,hardworking and open to new ideas I will be able to do greater things than Gilbert Eugiene Peters. After all I am an Edoofian</div></div>
