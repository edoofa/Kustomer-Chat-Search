<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 23:14 - Unknown:  So Shammah, I hope you are aware of the three projects that we have right?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/11/22, 23:16 - Shammah EWYL22E0384:  Yes I am</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/11/22, 00:19 - Unknown:  So can you briefly share with me about all three projects Shammah?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/11/22, 00:44 - Shammah EWYL22E0384:  In the first project the aim is for me to understand the field I'm going into and since the world has moved to be technologically driven I have a great chance to look into companies that have digitalized. Firstly I have to identify such companies in my country and\/or region. I can talk to my relatives, my friends relatives and others who are in such companies and tell them about my career choice, my objectives and how Edoofa is helping me acquire the skills I need especially after my graduation. Next is creating a LinkedIn account where I'll be able to connect to decision makers and employees in these these companies. I should reach out to these individuals and tell them or enlighten them about Edoofa.  Next I should setup a meeting  between Edoofa and these companies. In looking for potential companies there are 4 factors I should consider. The first is nature of company, the second is scale of the company, the third is financial stability of the company then lastly is the background of the company's founder. Along with these factors there are steps I should follow. The first step is searching where I can use either Google or LinkedIn. The second step is studying a little more about the company and it's functions. The third step is to study the company's website. This will help me get brief information on the founders and members. Step 4 is to check the various social media pages of the company. Step 5 is to understand and study the background of the founder and the core members. The last step is reaching out to these people by dropping an invitation and sending a connection request</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/11/22, 00:47 - Shammah EWYL22E0384:  In the second project I'm supposed to approach my colleagues, friends and family members who want to study abroad. Tell them about Edoofa and give them the knowledge I got from my experience and from my counselor. I'm also supposed to tell them about the expenses of studying abroad and how Edoofa has helped students in this area and also I'm supposed to identify students who are highly oriented who are willing to study abroad. Once I identify these students an offline application will be sent to me which I will share however I will have to identify the serious students before I share the information I have.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/11/22, 00:48 - Shammah EWYL22E0384:  In the third project I'm supposed to reach out to local and speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. Firstly I'm supposed to make a list of secondary schools in my local area. I can do this either through LinkedIn or through my personal network. Edoofa will help me reach out to them through messages and emails. A contract will be signed hence the decision makers of these schools and the Edoofa team will meet for the signing of this contract.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/12/22, 21:49 - Unknown:  Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.
