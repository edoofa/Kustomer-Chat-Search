It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/10/22, 21:10 - Aditi Kapoor:  I am happy to tell you that this weekend we are having our great Indian festival, Deepawali and you know this festival holds a special place in the hearts of all Indian families. So yesterday, everyone in our office wore Ethnic dresses and celebrate Deepawali's party where we exchanged gifts and lit up the office with diyas and candles.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/10/22, 21:10 - Aditi Kapoor:  In this week's lesson, you are going to learn about the living example of humility and humanitarian value. How a kid, hailing from a poverty-stricken family in a small village in Senegal, with no resources and very little support from his family, believing just in his determination and skills, following a dream to give his family and community a better life, went on to become the first Socrates of world football, and an inspiration for an entire generation to come, not only in his country but the entire world.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/11/22, 01:19 - Shamyce EWYL22E0339:  The Wednesday wisdom is about a saying \"winners never give up\". There is an example of African community called Siddis who came here for work. They ended up becoming rulers of certain states in India. Malik Ambar who was one of the most prominent people became prime minister, and military leader and then kingmaker. As a community they kept on growing and expanding and this showed that they never gave up.</div></div>
