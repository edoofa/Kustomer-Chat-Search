<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/08/22, 21:50 - Aditi Kapoor:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

I wish to put more effort than before. I wish to earn credits of at least $200. To achieve this i wish to get at least 3 projects to work on this month and for them to be fruitful i have to devote at least 3 hours of my time everyday towards my work and projects . I wish to be part of the Hair Extensions project, working with Ms Yasmin and many more projects. All of this will surely be achieved  under the supervision and guidance of my mentor so i wish to spend more of time now asking and looking for help from her in order to produce good work.</div></div>
