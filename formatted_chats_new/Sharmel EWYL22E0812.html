<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/12/22, 20:54 - Sharmel EWYL22E0812:  Christmas is a widely celebrated festival commemorating birth of Jesus Christ. It is a special day celebrated on the 25th day of December. It is where people gather as family, friends or even neighbors just yo celebrate,  or share stories. It is more special when people give or receive gifts even the smallest one still counts, or a song, a poet designed with love. I want to be my aunt's secret Santa this Christmas. I want to buy her a necklace that has a picture of her specially made for, because ever since my mother died she has been my pillar of strength. There were times I would breakdown, fail or think I am all alone in this world but she was there to comfort me, give me the kind of affection I needed, provided me with anything I wanted. With all that,  she is a mother figure,  she gives me mother's love and I don't feel left out.</div></div>
