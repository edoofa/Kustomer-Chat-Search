Don't worry Sharon that's completely all right. I understand there are many connectivity issues there and I could completely relate to the difficulty that you might be facing. For now, I want you to focus on the EWYL sessions that you have where we discuss our Wednesday lesson, weekend activity, newsletter, and our ongoing three projects. I know you are a very bright kid and I have so many upcoming projects in the coming weeks. When this issue gets resolved, let me know. Till then put all your focus on your ongoing EWYL sessions that are held on the EWYL LINE every MONDAY AND THURSDAY.</div></div>
