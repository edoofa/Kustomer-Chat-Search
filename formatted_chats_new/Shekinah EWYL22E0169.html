<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 22:49 - Jasmine Kaur:  Can you please give me a detailed understanding Shekinah?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 02:11 - Shekinah EWYL22E0169:  When you develop a culture of blaming others you lose self confidence . For example if you had a group project you won’t contribute because you’re afraid that if the project fails you’re going to be blamed. In other words you now believe that everyone is like you who blames others.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
