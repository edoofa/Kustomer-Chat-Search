<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/07/22, 19:40 - Sheunesu EWYL22E0059:  The business sector has been one of the most flourishing sectors in my country. There's this other company called TVV. It was started in 2018 and it has opened several branches in about five cities in Zimbabwe. It specializes in a lot of things, that is, airtime, sim cards, baby wear, stationary, photocopying and printing, only to mention a few. It has became one of those companies favoured by the people due to good customer service and again good quality of products and offering affordable prices. I can foresee it making headlines in the near future because it has grown so rapidly and it's showing no signs of backing down. As a way to keep up in the business sector, I think TVV needs to remain flooded with the products it offers and continue winning the hearts of the customers by providing good quality products at affordable prices</div></div>
