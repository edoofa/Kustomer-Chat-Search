I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/08/22, 17:44 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0671:  The major takeaways from the Wednesday wisdom lesson was you do not need to start big to become an entrepreneur, and it doesn't always go the way we want to go but perseverance is the key. Mr Gilbert had to suffer through a lot like separation from friends but that did not stop him from building an empire and above all when one decides to do something, he\/she should be able to be surrounded by people who will support them despite tge challenges</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/08/22, 19:51 - Unknown:  Simbarashe,  Good to read your understanding of the lesson Edoofian. The life of Gilbert Eugene Peters is inspiring and motivating as it help us understand that if you want results, you need to be willing to pay the price. The price is both easier than you imagine and harder than you think. The price is consistently making the small choices that put you on the path to success for years. The price is knowing that time is working on your side even when the results don’t show it, yet.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">04/08/22, 22:54 - Simbarashe EWYL21E0671:  Ok sir am learning</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">05/08/22, 00:42 - Unknown:  You see Simbarashe,  lack of consistency keeps ordinary people from achieving extraordinary results. Excelling at the small choices that compound over time perpetually leaves you in favorable circumstances. No matter what happens in the world, you’re never in a position where you are forced into a bad decision.</div></div>
