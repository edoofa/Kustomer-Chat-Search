<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/08/22, 20:32 - Simon EWYL21E0159:  From the Wednesday wisdom l learnt a lot of things in life. Firstly on the the very firstly point which said ''forget luck ,live by intent l understood nothing in life comes without me as an individual putting effort towards it. Yes in life opportunities do exist but one has to rely on his\/her willpower because we don't know when in life these opportunities will meet us .ln life the only input to the goals we dream if is hardworking.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/08/22, 20:46 - Simon EWYL21E0159:  From the second point which talked about failure l understood that failure is not the end but it is just a milestone for you to reflect that the method that you have been using towards a goal does not fits it. We have to take failure as a lesson not as punishment. Failure acknowledge us to reshuffle our methods inorder to achieve a goal</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
