<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/03/23, 23:25 - Saloni Rastogi:  I completely agree with you and I believe experiences make us feel alive: there are times when we live our lives and slowly let them pass us by. This can happen when you stick to the same routine day and night without doing anything new. Going through life in the same 'state' can be tedious, but an unforgettable experience will awaken your mind and soul.</div></div>
