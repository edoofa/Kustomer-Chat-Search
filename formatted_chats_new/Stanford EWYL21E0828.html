<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 18:01 - Stanford EWYL21E0828:  From all the stories about successful people Ms. Davi have given us I noticed something, all those people have something common, they are all hard working sometimes things will not work as planned but they will never give up they keep on going until they make it. You know sometimes you have to learn from others mistakes or problems to avoid facing the same problems that person faced or you will know how to copy with that same situation why? because you will be strong and have the courage to keep on going since you know you are not the first person to face problems, like what someone said before, behind every successful person there is a story, most of these successful people they had to go through alot to get where there are right now. People tend to be only motivated by what a person own right now but that is not it you have to also learn from all the struggles successful people went through to be successful and this will keep you strong when ever you think of quiting. Like what Patrice Motsepe went through, he wanted to buy a money but he did have the money so he had to run around in a bid to source the money before the opportunity slip away, he went to the bank and they refused because he was the first black man to own a mine maybe they didn't believe in him I guess, but he did not give up just because someone is not supporting your dreams. Whenever you try to do something some people will oppose you and some will support you and you have to keep on believing in yourself you have to remain with a positive mind and you will definitely make it.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 20:13 - Stanford EWYL21E0828:  I have a question.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 01:33 - Unknown:  Stanford Inam very well aware of that. The reason I chose you for the course is that you are willing to pursue Btech in computer science and I am sure this will bring so much knowledge and will prove to be very insightful for you. Don't worry about the age.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 01:33 - Unknown:  And I will inform you about the course ver soon.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 02:54 - Stanford EWYL21E0828:  Digital literacy is important because it boost one's engagement when trying to explain something e.g project, people will have a better understanding since your presentation will be clear and straight forward and digital literacy really helps one to have a creative mind, to be able to evaluate any information in a critical way and taking technology courses from online websites e.g skooqs can help you have codings skills and designing skills and that help you to be able to adapt to new technology.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 02:54 - Stanford EWYL21E0828:  Game graphics are developed by creating 3D models of characters, environments and props, these models are then used to create images and animation for the character movements also 2D assests are used such as textures. If you have a vision or you want to create video games you should pursue technical courses across animation and game development and I encourage you to use E-learning websites like skooqs they offer more courses and you are guaranteed to be so experienced after each and every course you do.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 18:58 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 19:02 - Unknown:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today Stanford, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 19:02 - Unknown:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">24/07/22, 17:03 - Stanford EWYL21E0828:  2. The best way for kids to start learning kid coding classes is by firstly teaching the kid how to use a laptop or a computer before moving to coding. After that the kid can now start to do one on one lessons with mentor that will teach the kid from basic programming. After a while on face to face with mentors the kid can now start to look for websites that can improve his or her skills preferably Skooqs since it have a lot to offer in terms of technology especially to kids of age 9-18 years.</div></div>
