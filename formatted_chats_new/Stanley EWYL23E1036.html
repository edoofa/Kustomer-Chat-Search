<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/01/24, 18:46 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Okay, as exposed by this link above, International exposure can benefit my career since it gives me a proper insight on how to handle things.  As l  was going through the pages I saw some proud Edoofians having some carrier guidances, good lecturing skills and also I can see their successes through this page. As such I can comment that this program is a wonderful program to those who are motivated in learning. It also gives opportunities for one to even fly high and also come with flying colors moreover it covers most people's motives to study abroad. Therefore I can see to my own point of view this scholarship program is the Paramount to every Edoofian to reach highest levels of Education and the scholarship and also to have a high employment step in life</div></div>

It's fantastic that the link showcases the success stories and achievements of Edoofians, highlighting the benefits of the program. Recognizing the importance of career guidance, excellent lecturing skills, and the overall success of participants speaks volumes about the quality of the program.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/01/24, 13:50 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Really  thank you Ms Ananya</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/01/24, 13:55 - Ananya:  Now moving ahead I want to discuss something really important with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/01/24, 13:57 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Okay mentor mmm which feedback</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/01/24, 14:30 - Ananya:  Alright, Stanley, I will try to do that! Now that our session time is over, let's reconvene in our next session on Tuesday! Meanwhile, don't forget to connect with the students over the weekend so that we can meet our target of connecting with at least 5 students next week!</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:28 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Noo I would like you to make me know</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:29 - Ananya:  You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:30 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Okay sure thank you I would  like to make my own resume about Edoofa</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:37 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Okay let me go through  this</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:48 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Yes I have gone through  that its a good tutorial</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:51 - Ananya:  By thw way, last time we talked about how you can set yourself a target and work on that over the weekend. Did you manage to plan out your work?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:52 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Yes I tried to get some students but some we complaining  that we are the fist students to apply  and we haven't picked yet I resended that in our EWYL group</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:54 - Ananya:  Please let them know that due to a huge number of application forms and the intensive understanding of your application form, it requires a window of 15-20 days for our counselors to connect with you for the counseling session.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:56 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Okay thank I would like you to inform them in my group</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 14:06 - Ananya:  I understand; however, giving you control has an intent behind it - to make you a student leader and build some leadership skills. If you can manage a set of students and handle them, this will ensure confidence building and leadership abilities.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 14:07 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Sure that my mentor  thats a pretty good  advise</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/01/24, 21:45 - Stanley EWYL23E1036:  Okay, in this I go for "power of thoughts".  On the power of thoughts, it is elaborated that's whatever one think of may come to pass. This guides people to have a positive mental attitude. This is a train to failure or success in life. Moreover, it shapes reality in our day today lives. For example if one always talks about misfortunes in his lives, those misfortunes will come to reality. Napoleon Hill also exemplified that if you maintain a a positive mind you always have positive impacts as it comes to reality. For instance one will always dreaming of having a good life or something great in his real life that's dream will come to reality since it is always the dream of that person. Lastly, Napoleon suggested that it is very important for one to program his or your mind on success because it will come to pass in reality</div></div>
