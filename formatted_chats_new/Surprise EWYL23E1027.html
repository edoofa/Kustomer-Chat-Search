You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">16/01/24, 13:28 - Ananya:  You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.</div></div>
