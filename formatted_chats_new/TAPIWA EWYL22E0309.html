<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 03:38 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309:  Becoming a game developer is just as hard as getting into any other career, but with added competition and the need to be constantly fresh and relevant. However, by applying yourself and keeping your long-term goals in mind, it can be a rewarding and fulfilling career as easy to progress through as anything. Most game software developers have a formal education background, with at least a bachelor's degree. Employers tend to prefer candidates who have completed four-year degree courses as they have a more in-depth scientific grounding that is necessary for game development. However, there is a way one can get the skill nurtured since childhood for example, one of my nephew joined an online learning course \"Skooqs\" 2 years ago. The course enables kids to develop their technology skills, game development inclusive so therefore when the skill is develop since childhood then it will become a very simple task in the long run.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 21:06 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309:  1. Strong IT skills are needed for one to become a game developer. There is need for skills such as critical thinking, effective communication, creativity and programming knowledge. Beyond coding, you need to have a flair of design. As graphics and animation play a huge role in video games, game designers need to be familiar with character design, scenery design and used interface design. So for one to develop all these skills, there are various courses and even online they may partake for example the Skooqs program which teaches programming from the youngest age. With the use of such online programmes, one can get the best game development skills ever.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/07/22, 21:17 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309:  2. There are a lot various websites which offer online teaching activities for kids. Basing on my experience, one of my nephews joined the Skooqs online course for programming just two years ago and speaking of now, he is a very great programmer. Only 6 months after he has started the course, he started creating very great video games so I highly recommend the Skooqs course for all kids who would like to engage in programming.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">18/07/22, 21:38 - Unknown:  Tapiwa, I am now sharing your weekly report with you. Here are the tasks that you have missed out on.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 00:02 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309:  3. Scratch is a great tool for developing the programming skills of learners, since it allows all manner of different programs to be built. The most important thing in any Scratch program are the sprites. Sprites are the graphical objects or characters that perform a function in your program. The default sprite in Scratch is the cat, which can easily be changed. The stage is basically the background of your project. Like sprites, the stage can have different costumes that change as the story plays out. The stage window is the main area where the action of your program takes place. The set of instructions that is used to program in Scratch is called a script. It is a stack or collection of blocks that connect with one another. There are also various other practices in scratch programming so for one to become a successful scratch programmer, there can be use of various online programming courses. Well to be specific, one of my nephews has been attending Skooqs online programming course since he was 5years old. One thing I like about the Skooqs program is that they can teach kids to become the best programmers and I therefore recommend Skooqs for all kids who would like to become successful programmers.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 01:30 - TAPIWA EWYL22E0309:  4. Kids may use the internet during their spare time. The internet also provides kids with information they may basically need even in their education. There are various websites that can entertain kids such as free and fun, PBS kids, Sesame Street and many more. There are also other various websites that may help kids develop helpful skills that may also help them in life such as the *Skooqs* page. Skooqs gives various computing courses online, which gives kids the best programming and coding experiences ever. With such helpful sites, our kids will grow up being smart.</div></div>
