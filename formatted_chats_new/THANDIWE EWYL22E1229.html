<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">18/05/23, 17:20 - Ananya:  Thank you for sharing your understanding of the Wednesday lesson. It is evident that servant leadership, characterized by the leader's consideration for employee views and building strong relationships, is crucial for success and achieving greatness. In contrast, traditional leadership, which focuses solely on profit and progress without recognizing employee needs, can lead to loss of talented individuals due to arrogance and poor leadership skills.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 15:56 - Ananya:  That is wonderful, so would you like to share your thoughts on it?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 16:08 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229:  I found it very motivating in that when you discover your emotions,strengths and weaknesses, you  find a plan to work towards them. One also gets to plan how to do his work whilst considering the above mentioned. Just like Mr Barrack Obama did, he was able to identify his true self and be self aware, this helped him to use his strengths to deal with a lot of issues whilst he worked on his weaknesses. I was very motivated by the Wednesday lesson</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/05/23, 16:08 - Ananya:  I agree with the sentiment expressed in your statement about self-awareness. Our Wednesday wisdom emphasized the importance of being honest with one's feelings and taking time for self-reflection. For instance, former President Obama dedicated 4-5 hours of his time alone after dinner, which allowed him to delve deeper into self-discovery.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 16:03 - THANDIWE EWYL22E1229:  From what i experience, it is a great personality because some of my friends actually come to me when they have problems. Even when they want to go out, they wont go out without me  because they say I uplift their spirits. Naturally I enjoy socializing with people and that has exposed me to many new things. All I can say is an Orange personality lights up the world</div></div>

I also realized that sometimes my emotions get the best of me. My strengths are that Iam hardworking, honest, caring, compassionate and kind . I can also crave some alone time in a peaceful environment when i want to clear my head.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">29/05/23, 16:26 - Ananya:  It is commendable that you have recognized your preference for efficiency and a dislike for slow-paced activities. Additionally, your acknowledgment of occasionally being swayed by your emotions demonstrates self-awareness.</div></div>
