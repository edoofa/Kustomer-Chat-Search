<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/03/23, 22:56 - Unknown:  The concept of wealth has been a topic of much debate and discussion for centuries. While some view wealth as a means to achieve success and fulfillment, others may view it with suspicion or even disdain. However, it is important to understand that ethical wealth creation is possible and can be a force for good in the world. In this regard, it is essential to examine our own perspectives on wealth creation, and consider how they may impact our relationship with money, status, and success.","transform":"</div></div>
