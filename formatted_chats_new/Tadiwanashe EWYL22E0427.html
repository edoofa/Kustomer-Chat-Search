<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/10/22, 21:19 - Ananya:  It is important Tadiwanashe that you realize that I have all my time reserved for my students. I feel happy to motivate my students to learn new skills each week and share with me how those lessons have impacted and brought a change in them. And you know what, the way you want to earn scholarship credits and help yourself financially, I am working 10 times more than everyone so that all my students avail the best out of this opportunity. But I feel more saddened for the fact that each time I have to make you realize to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', this is something which should be done by you without any reminders.</div></div>
