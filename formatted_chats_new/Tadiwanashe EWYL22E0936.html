<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/09/23, 12:31 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936:  The first was to seek support. I still remember one of the key terms we talked about with the Edoofa counselors was team work or family spirit. You can never underestimate the power of family spirit. Communication is one of the best ways one can maintain a healthy status and with the help of others, it is easier to manage time responsibly.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/09/23, 12:43 - Tadiwanashe EWYL22E0936:  The first exam tip u can get from me is never give up because lot is going to be on your way and never stop praying. Have faith in what you are doing. Another thing is never hesitate to try something because the result will tell you if you was wrong or right. Another things is plan a study schedule that covers all topics and if it js hard for you break them into smaller chunks that will make it easier for you to understand. It is also important to take some breaks and refreshments when studying because the mind needs to rest after doing something. Prioritise the most important topics and take them seriously so that they don't cost you in exams. Study groups have also proven to be helpful as you can gather new things that you didn't grasp in your previous work.</div></div>

And sometimes it's not that simple to answer. As for me honestly, I don't know where I'll be, but what I have certain goals and ambitions that I feel like I have to fulfill in my life. People see it as an easy question , but when it comes right into your face maybe in a job interview or something, it might cost you .
