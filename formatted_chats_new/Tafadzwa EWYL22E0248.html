This helps me bear in mind on how Iam supposed to consume time wisely, productively and  efficiently thereby making me get closer to my vision. The second skill set is creating a master list daily. This is a list on how I will spend my time. It acts as a remembrance of usefull tasks that Iam supposed to accomplish at a particular time. Third skill is use of Productive Cycle. Here Iam supposed to take note of time of the day when I will be having a huge amount of focus and energy and start executing the most important task. Last but not least, delegating my tasks and making use of available resources helps me to increase my work efficiency.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
