<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/10/22, 15:46 - Takudzwa EWYL22E0221:  1. In my Wednesday wisdom, I learnt about humility as it is from this very popular footballer, Mane. He is the popular person known for being a millionaire with a broken iPhone which taught me not to focus on material things but to focus on the opportunities I have and make the best out of them.</div></div>

So far, I have learnt that deepawali is festival of lights  celebrated here in India, the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. There will be plenty of fireworks and lights as well.</div></div>

Without struggle, we humans won't be able to achieve what we have today.</div></div>
