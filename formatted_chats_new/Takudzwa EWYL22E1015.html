<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/03/23, 20:54 - Aditi Kapoor:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/03/23, 20:54 - Aditi Kapoor:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/03/23, 20:54 - Aditi Kapoor:  In our scheduled session on Tuesday we will discuss how we can best do the community-building project.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi:  I kindly remind you that our sessions are scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays from 12:00-01:30 pm. It is important that you make a sincere effort to be present in each session. If, for any reason, you anticipate being late, please inform me in advance. Similarly, if you are unable to attend a session, please ensure that you share your responses beforehand so that I can review them during our scheduled time.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/06/23, 16:38 - Saloni Rastogi:  I must express my disappointment in the fact that our session time has been consistently wasted due to your failure to follow the daily ritual on the EWYL Line. It is disheartening for me to spend a significant portion of our time reminding you about the session and urging you to adhere to the daily ritual. Your commitment to being punctual and proactive in our sessions is essential for our progress and mutual benefit.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">27/06/23, 18:59 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1015:  I learnt that determination and thirst for knowledge can overcome any obstacle and that nomatter what situation we may face we must embrace tough times as opportunities to grow and strive for excellence and inorder to be a true leader it needs courage to make difficult decisions with compassion to uplift others in times of challanges. Honest and integrity are essential attributes for a leader as they bring fought trust and foster a culture of fairness and also we must advocate for equal opportunities and create and inclusive society that celebrates diversity. Education is also something which should be valued and we must seize opportunities for growth and work towards empowering ourselves and our communities and ability to collaborate and create diplomacy can help achieve shared goals hence promoting peace and stability. We must not also forget the importance of preserving our planet and strive to be responsible stewards of the environment contributing to a sustanaible future. We must also embrace our ability to effect change no matter our ages or background and live to aspire a positive and lasting legacy in our communities.</div></div>

Inspired by Alex's story and identity-based habits, let's dive into an exciting writing exercise. Envision yourself as the protagonist, reflecting on your current habits and aspirations. Write a short narrative that describes your journey of transformation. Imagine your ideal self—the person you aspire to be—and consider the qualities, values, and habits that define this version of you.</div></div>
