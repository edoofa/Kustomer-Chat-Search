<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:00 - Aditi Kapoor:  Yes you see there is a common confusion that comes everytime rearding the EWYL</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:01 - Aditi Kapoor:  So basically the EWYL Program helps you pay off the fees by earning scholarship credits</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:02 - Aditi Kapoor:  But most of the times students don't perform well in the projects and by the time the exams are coming, they will not be able to pay the fees which will ultimately result in blocked attendance and they are not allowed to sit for the exams</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:04 - Aditi Kapoor:  So the earning part of the EWYL is sometimes considered as a free scholarship which is not, in fact without putting in any efforts, you will not be awarded for free in anything</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:05 - Aditi Kapoor:  Can you understand what I am trying to say?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:06 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228:  Yes I understand that, so if you don't mind me asking how much credits have I earned from those candidates on application forms</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:07 - Aditi Kapoor:  So there is a revision on the community building project</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:07 - Aditi Kapoor:  for every 25 students who undergoes the counselling process, you will be awarded $10</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:08 - Aditi Kapoor:  Moreover if you can get students from South Africa, you will be awarded $25 per enrollment and this is exclusive only for you</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:08 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228:  From the ones I previously sent how many have went through counseling</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:09 - Takudzwa EWYL22E1228:  Yes there are two students I got but exclusively one of them was interested</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:10 - Aditi Kapoor:  It usually takes a week or 10 days to reach out to the students so allow me some time to check up</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/03/23, 01:11 - Aditi Kapoor:  Well you see out of the two of them again, if he enrolls then only you will get the credits so it is important that they enroll too as you told me they are interested but if they don't enroll then that is a false impression right?</div></div>

In the worst-case scenario, if you are not able to complete the task given to you before the deadline due to *a genuine* reason, you will *only* be given the credits for the tasks you have accomplished, so make sure not to miss out on any task to attain the maximum credits from this project.</div></div>
