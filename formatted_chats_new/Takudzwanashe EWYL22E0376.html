I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing. On the mindset of successful people, they have focus on their source of income and possible ways that can help them in the generation of more income.
