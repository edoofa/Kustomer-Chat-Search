Christmas is the perfect time when friends and families come together, spreading joy and happiness. You must be aware of the concept of \"SECRET SANTA,\" but do you know who he or she was, or how the lovely process of sharing joy began? In today's Wednesday Wisdom, let's find out more about secret Santa. Secret Santa has a special message for you at the end. We'll get in touch and discuss your takeaways in more detail.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/12/22, 18:12 - Takunda EWYL22E0524:  From the Wednesday Wisdom lesson I understood that a Secret Santa is  a person who demonstrates kindness to people while hiding his true identity. There are no special requirements of an individual to become a Secret Santa, Anyone who is willing to show kindness and come to peoples rescue when they are in trouble or need support can become one .A good example is  highlighted in the document when Cookie handed a 20 dollar note to Larry who was not able to afford a hot meal and cater for his gas tank to drive to town. When things were flowing well on  Larry's side, he had to withdraw one third of his salary to demonstrate the same kindness he had witnessed when he was in need of support.</div></div>
