You should also discuss with them your journey right from submitting your application till you got connected with me. You can inform them about your counsellor, the interviews, admission processes, etc. and once that is done, you can ask them to fill out the Offline Application Form. One thing which you need to keep in mind is that you should only reach out to students who you feel are equally passionate and deserving like you to earn the scholarship. [preferably the ones who have completed their A-Level or are in Form 6\/Form 5]. Also, make sure that you share the correct information with the applicant while sharing the application form.</div></div>
