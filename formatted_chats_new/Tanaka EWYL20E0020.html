<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 23:50 - Unknown:  Paidamoyo, It's time for Wednesday Wisdom, and this week we're going to learn how the son of a former teacher in an African school made over $1 billion dollars. You did read it correctly.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. RitualsÂ motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
