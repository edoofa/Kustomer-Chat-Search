<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:02 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460:  'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am  Tanaka Mukahanana and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is 22E0460</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:03 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460:  I am a proud EDOOFIAN'</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:04 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:06 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460:  Not to be rude but ... Why do I have to say it daily though</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:19 - Unknown:  Greetings Tanaka!</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:21 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460:  I'm doing great!</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:21 - Unknown:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow who is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind whenever you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:22 - Unknown:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">13/10/22, 00:58 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460:  Alright... Understood</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/10/22, 18:18 - Unknown:  I see you have typed 2 and 3, which reflects unclarity as to who an edoofian is and what it denotes.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/10/22, 18:21 - Unknown:  We all must have heard of the phrase \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". This briefly means that, even in circumstances and situations where things tend to seem impossible to do, one can still find out a way to perform his deeds.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/10/22, 18:22 - Unknown:  Along with this, I have an amazing opportunity for you, but I will share with you only when you will share with me what you have learned from the Wednesday lesson and the video that was to be sent for the weekend activity.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/10/22, 18:23 - Tanaka EWYL22E0460:  No video was sent to me last week ... I don't remember receiving a video</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/10/22, 18:27 - Unknown:  Tanaka, sorry for the error. I have another student named Tanaka and the lesson was sent to her twice, I will send you again.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/10/22, 18:28 - Unknown:  Will that be okay?</div></div>
