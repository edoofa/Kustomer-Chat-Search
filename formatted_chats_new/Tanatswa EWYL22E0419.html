I don't know maybe it's my cellphone that has a problem. I tried to use Google to collect information on the companies but to know avail. On the other hand, I can't log in to my LinkedIn account. I even tried to download the app but I could not. Maybe if I find another phone it would be easier. Right now I've tried everything I thought can help but I'm now out of ideas.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">18/12/22, 07:33 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419:  It is a well known saying that giving with love and happiness brings more joy than receiving. As a result, people often try to give gifts to as many people as they can. There are also many events whereby people share gifts. On these events or days , everyone will be expecting gifts from loved ones; friends and family. These include weddings, birthdays and the famous Christmas day among others. Each of these days has its own tradition and way different from each other, but there is one thing in common; each of the loved ones want or wishes to give the best gift. Of interest among the events I mentioned earlier is the Christmas day. It has its own interesting tradition, the tradition of the secret Santa. It is after our Wednesday wisdom that I came to understand the origin of the famous ' secret Santa ' Christmas tradition that is practised with so much joy worldwide, by everyone regardless of religion, age, geographic location or culture. On this upcoming Christmas, I would like to be a secret Santa to my younger brother. I want to buy him a Bluetooth speaker he always admired . I know it can not be the best gift of all the gifts he will receive but I believe he is going to like it and treasure it wholeheartedly. As a student that's the best I can afford for him but in the future, I will try to give him something more than that and celebrate our Christmas day with so much joy and happiness. It is also my wish to be a secret Santa to as many people as I can and continue with the tradition of giving without being identified!</div></div>

Then we return home and prepare a feast of very delicious dishes and enjoy as a family. After that family members secretly put their gifts in a room . Then the older members visit relatives while the the young ones go with friends to the local shops and complete the day. People open their gifts on the 26th. One of the Christmas days I will always remember is the Christmas day of 2018. All the family members were present and we received a lot of gifts. I personally received a blue track suit and many other gifts.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">23/12/22, 00:23 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0419:  I'm able and I understood everything, but to put that in practise, there comes the problem. For example I tried to use LinkedIn but I could not log in using my Facebook account. I tried to download the app but to no avail. When I tried to use Google, a little information was provided. The problem is that my cellphone has a weak signal that's what I concluded.</div></div>
