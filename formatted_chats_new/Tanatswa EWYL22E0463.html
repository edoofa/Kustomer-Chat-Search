<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/03/23, 07:20 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0463:  A North Star Metric helps a business manage it's operating procedures. It guides what the business stands for and it's ideal purpose. It unites all participants with the goal clearly outlined and removes distractions that may cause the business to deviate from the main purpose hence the word focus is clearly defined.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/03/23, 08:32 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0463:  As a student, a North Star Metric would be a great starting point to success and excellence. As a high school student, there are many distractions  that might deviate our focus from education but I personally believe when one chooses to focus on a goal everything else should be blurred. The goal of my life is to pass my A level and work well with the Edoofa team so as to attain a higher tertiary education and do mechatronics a course that I desire. Focusing on this goal requires one to have a   vibrant academic, social, physical and spiritual lifestyle; I believe that is what North Star Metric is all about; being able to define your goal and how to achieve it. A dream with action is a goal and a dream without action is a wish. I believe that knowing where you have started, where you are and where you want to be is what makes true goals stand.</div></div>
