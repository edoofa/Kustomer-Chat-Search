<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/02/23, 00:26 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0998:  Well, from Wednesday wisdom I understood that for students to share skills, lesson and experience which help to became creative and discover our true self and most importantly to develop new skills that will aid us in our journey to became successful professionals. Building network can became an excellent way to gain new prospector and ideas. It helps us to understand what we want and were w want to work in the future. Students starting university can find it difficult to grasp the idea of what they want to do, what they want for their future or for the course or does it apply to everyone or not. Some have already decided what they want to do in the future but are not using LinkedIn which can help them gain better prospections of your career path .</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/02/23, 00:27 - Tanatswa EWYL22E0998:  From the Newsletter have learnt how to build a strong network with LinkedIn, you start by strengthening LinkedIn profile highlighting all of your best work this gives the decision makers of the companies an idea of the quality of work you have to offer. There's also use of LinkedIn groups and building your digital footprint.</div></div>
