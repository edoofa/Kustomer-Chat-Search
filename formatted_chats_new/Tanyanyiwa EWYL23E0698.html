<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/12/23, 16:44 - Ananya:  Well, alright! You can share this : Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?  Coming from a similar historical background of being ruled by the Britishers once, I was certain  of similarities between the Indian and the African cultures.  It has been 3 months that I have been living in India and even though it took adapting to the  environment, weather, and culture, it is so gratifying because it is a country full of resources that  are so cheap and affordable.  I was fortunate to come at a time when India hosted the G20 summit 2023 this year. The G20  summit is an annual international gathering of leaders from the world's 20 major economies,  representing both developed and emerging nations. It was such a proud moment for me  because fortunately this year The African Union became a full member of the G20 which  happened under Indiaâ€™s presidency. I believe this will help the development process in Africa  and draw investment to the continent which also means more opportunities for us here and back  home.  My understanding of India on the global map has greatly improved since I got here. The CEOs  and Directors of all leading companies like Google, Microsoft, Channel, Nokia, and IBM have all  been Indian graduates.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">16/12/23, 17:44 - Tanyanyiwa EWYL23E0698:  A story is told of a young boy who was very intelligent but was from a very poor background.This young boy was very determined.He was a humble person and a hard worker.Throughout his childhood he had dreams,he wanted to be a medical doctor but not only that, he wanted to be the best medical doctor in Zimbabwe.Unfortunately his parents had nothing,they could not even afford to pay for his education but this young boy was very determined and the word failure was not in his vocabulary.He started doing piece jobs so that he could raise money to pay for his education.In his neighbourhood there was a private school which was unaffordable so he would walk 20 kilometers  to the nearest government school which was affordable.He gave his all in school work and managed to attain distinctions  at Ordinary Level.His parents were proud of him and wanted him to go further but unfortunately they had nothing .At the school he learnt there was no Advanced level ,but as a perspiring doctor he had to do Advanced Level.As they say ,"The Almighty always pave way where there is no way." This young found a well wisher who was a teacher at the neighbouring school who was willing to pay fees for him.He was very happy and he took advantage of this opportunity.He worked extremely hard.He would study all night.He scored 15 points and made everyone so proud.He had all he needed to study medicine except for financial backup.He applied for a Higher life scholarship which is given to vulnerable students and lucky enough he got it.He went to study at the University of Zimbabwe for seven years and graduated with a first class degree in Bachelor of Surgery.Finally his dream was fulfilled and he made his parents proud.</div></div>
