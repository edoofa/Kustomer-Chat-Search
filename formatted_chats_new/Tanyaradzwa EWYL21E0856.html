Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe’s success story is a remarkable one showing how curiosity, doggedness, perseverance, and the knack to exploit great opportunities as they come, can determine how successful or not, any individual could become.</div></div>

The  Establishment  of  The  African  Rainbow  Minerals  (ARM). After  saving  up  for  many  years,  in  1997  when  the  price  of  Gold  was  falling,  one  of  the  largest  mining  companies  in South  Africa,  AngloGold,  was  looking  to  sell  some  of  their  smaller,  older,  low-performing  mine  shafts,  so  they  could focus  on  their  larger  and  higher  performing  mines. With  this  golden  opportunity  staring  him  in  the  face,  Patrice  Motsepe  promptly  founded  the  African  Rainbow Minerals  (ARM)  and  proceeded  to  acquire  one  of  the  mine  shafts  that  were  up  for  sale  by  AngloGold. With  a  price  tag  set  at  $8.2  million,  Patrice  Motsepe  had  to  run  around  in  a  bid  to  source  the  money  before  the opportunity  was  gone.  He  ran  to  the  banks,  but  they  refused  him  a  loan  because  the  mine  was  up  for  sale  for  being unprofitable,  and  besides,  no  black  South  African  had  ever  owned  a  mining  operation  before.Now  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Anglo’s  gold  and  uranium  division  at  the  time,  Bobby  Godsell,  decided  to  help Patrice  Motsepe  out,  since  he  knew  about  his  previous  mining  contract  services  and  had  also  observed  his  zeal  to want  to  venture  into  the  mining  business. They  struck  a  good  deal,  and  Bobby  Godsell  handed  over  the  mining  shafts  to  Patrice  Motsepe,  who  would  pay  the $8.2  million  cost  over  a  period  of  years. With  the  price  of  Gold  still  falling,  Patrice  Motsepe  had  to  take  drastic  steps  to  ensure  the  mine  had  a  full turnaround.  To  do  this,  he  implemented  a  lot  of  lean  operations,  downsized  the  staff  at  the  Orkney  mine  to  5,000 from  7,500,  cut  the  management  staff  in  half,  and  worked  from  a  building  located  in  Orkney,  so  he  could  supervise its  operations  directly  since  it  w</div></div>

It taught me a lesson of being a wise man with best mindset. Though there are some obstacles and challenges he faced but what he was striving for was very important that is why he never give up . A big lesson I learned about the story of Patrice  Motsepe is effort , passion , patience and never giving up on something which is so challenging and it leads to successfulness.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">28/07/22, 22:30 - Saloni Rastogi:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
