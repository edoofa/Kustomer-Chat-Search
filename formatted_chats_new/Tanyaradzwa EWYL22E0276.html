<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">28/07/22, 23:19 - Tanyaradzwa EWYL22E0276:  About the document on time management. My understanding is that good time management is to use time productively and efficiently. I learn that something urgent the task may not matter and and something important task matters by not doing them they may be consequences. So a good time manager knows the differ between these two urgent and important because it is the key to priorities time</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/08/22, 00:41 - Unknown:  A timetable is a framework that lets individuals see specific activities lined up. In this framework, it shows the tie allotment among several tasks and courses. It ensures equal distribution of time among activities and subjects, creates a smooth workflow, prevents wasting of time and efforts, and aids in creating good habits.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/08/22, 00:50 - Unknown:  A well-constructed timetable establishes a natural rhythm and routine, which can be comforting students as well as their mentors. Having a plan as a learner is very important as it helps you maximize and prioritize on the things that are of urgency or importance. Most students do not have an organized study plan and if they do, they fail to follow the plan drawn. As the Wednesday Wisdom offered advice on how to use our time wisely. You must share your daily schedules with your mentors as part of your Saturday activity in the format that has been provided to you. I've given you the image of a timetable; you can draw it on paper and show it to your mentors. Do not forget to provide the scheduled time for your EWYL programme.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">24/08/22, 21:42 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>
