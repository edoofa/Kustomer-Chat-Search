<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:18 - Jasmine Kaur:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

Just the act of committing to the effort makes us feel connected to everything and can help heal isolation, loneliness, and helplessness.</div></div>
