<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/06/23, 18:15 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189:  Very well Ms Ananya. Let me share my understanding of the Wednesday session to you</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/06/23, 18:29 - Tatenda EWYL22E1189:  In short, I understood that Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was a dedicated and strong woman who managed to become the first female president of Africa. However,  this presidency was not handed to her because of wealth or social status but rather her ability to rule and leadership qualities. These qualities include breaking of gender barriers, empowerment of youth and women , leadership in difficult times such as civil wars, diplomatic change and environmental stewardship. Her legacy teaches us as Edoofians how to become a great leader in both good and difficult times. Thus Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is an inspiration to every African student.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/06/23, 18:34 - Ananya:  Absolutely,the story of this great former president has provided us with a wealth of wisdom and insights, transforming our outlook on life and inspiring us to embody determination, resilience, unity, equality, honesty, and stewardship in our own journeys.</div></div>
