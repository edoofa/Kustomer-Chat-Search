<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">04/01/24, 14:34 - Ananya:  Well, I was expecting a timely response from your end. However, since our session time is over, let's connect in our next session. Please make an effort to be more regular during your sessions, considering it's just a one-and-a-half-hour-long session.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 13:33 - Ananya:  For today, I have planned something special! Do you know about a resume or a CV?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 13:34 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817:  I dont know much but l only have an idea</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 13:35 - Ananya:  You know, a resume is like a super important paper for students. It shows all the cool things you've done in school and outside. When you want to get into a good school or get a job, you give them your resume so they can see how awesome you are. It's like your personal advertisement that says, 'Hey, I'm really good at these things, and I can do great stuff for you!' So, having a good resume helps you stand out and get cool opportunities.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 13:38 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817:  Oooooooh wow thank you so much . I didnt know about resume . Please can you tell me more</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 13:39 - Ananya:  Well, yesterday I was updating my little brother's resume and took help from this video. I thought to share this with you as well, as he is suggesting some really good things!</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 13:45 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817:  This really helps thank you</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 13:47 - Ananya:  Now, please watch this video and create a resume by our next session. As of now, let us now discuss your EWYL project. Now moving ahead I want to discuss something significant with you. You know, seeing over 400 students in this event has motivated me to work for my students even harder. I want you to be here in India and pay your fee all by yourself. For this, I promise to assist you in every manner and make you feel like a proud Edoofian! To achieve this, you should take some baby steps and have a lot of faith in yourself to proceed with a big goal. You have limited time, start utilizing your weekend and set yourself a target. For example, you can set a goal of connecting with 5 students and be determined that you will reach this number and share the application forms with me by Monday. After that, you should always connect with me for a review so that you can evaluate and redefine your target. By the way, have you taken feedback from me earlier?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/01/24, 13:59 - Tatenda EWYL23E0817:  Well noted maam l will do my best to connect with more students</div></div>

Meanwhile, don't forget to connect with the students over the weekend so that we can meet our target of connecting with at least 5 students this week!</div></div>

I got enough time to understand the skills that my students should have if they wish to succeed in their future, covering the basic skills through the EWYL project. However, I was wondering if my students understand the core of the EWYL projects or not! So, tell me, do you even understand the intent behind these projects or not? If yes, what's that?</div></div>
