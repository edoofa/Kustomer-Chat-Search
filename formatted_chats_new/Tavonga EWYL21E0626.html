<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/07/22, 19:28 - Tavonga EWYL21E0626:  Yesterday's Wednesday lesson was about Patrice Motsepe who went on to make billions of dollars despite his father being a teacher once.Through his father's small store where mine workers came to buy liquor, Patrice got his first exposure to the mining business.He then met several mining organisations while he was a visiting attorney to McGuire Woods law firm in 1991,3 years after getting his LLB in 1988.He was very enthused and attracted by the business.This exposure sparked Patrice's  determination and he started to read books,articles and he did almost,if not everything he could so that he could get a full understanding about the mining business.Patrice was then appointed as Bowman Gilfillan law firm's first black partner in 1994.He then started to specialise in mining and business law and his exposure to the firm helped him to start his his own mining firm by the name Future Mining.He also went on to establish the African Rainbow Minerals and acquired Anglo Gold's mine shafts with the help of Bobby Godsell who was now the Chief Executive Officer of Anglo's gold and uranium department.After succeeding in turning the mining business around,he then partnered with Anglo Platinum,the world's largest platinum producer.He also partnered with South Africa's gold producer called Harmony.By 2017,Patrice had amassed a net worth of about $1.6 billion.From Patrice's story, l learnt that hard work and determination can lead a person to achieve all the set targets in his\/ her life.l also learnt that you have to take some risks along the way in order to succeed as Patrice risked acquiring the mine shafts and he also had his requests for loans from banks rejected but he never gave up and that is why never giving up is another lesson l also learnt.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">18/07/22, 22:17 - Saloni Rastogi:  The main objective behind this weekend activity was to make you go through the meaning of SWOT analysis. SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 20:46 - Tavonga EWYL21E0626:  Yesterday's Wednesday Lesson was about mastering the right attitude.I learnt that failure is often caused by putting blame on others instead of just accepting personal responsiblity.When people choose to blame,it only serves as a reason to give up and stop trying in challenging situations.Conversely, successful people do not cat blame but instead they accept personal responsibility,learn from their mistakes and rise up to the challenge in order to achieve success.In this lesson,I've learnt to not blame others for my failure as losers do but to accept responsibility,learn from my mistakes, to always have the right attitude and to mind how I approach and talk to other people.</div></div>
