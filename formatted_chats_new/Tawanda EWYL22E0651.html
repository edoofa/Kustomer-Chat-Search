This also helps not waste time on things which I know that they are not favoured by my personality. Knowing that l like to help others would help me building strong relationships which when l also need help let's say in my projects people would not hesitate to help since they know me very well. Also it would make my projects easy those people whom l help have got also their friends and families which can help me Link up with them more easily</div></div>

One of my main aim is to aquire knowledge from other nations which is not my own as this would help me and the people l will be working around to brainstorm on how to eradicate some certain diseases since we would have different version of the diseases and also to introduce some certain ways which are being used in other nations to treat people and it stands also as one of my objectives. Also l did like to say building a strong medical facility in my community is one of my aims as l know the kind of suffering they endure when it comes to medical facilities. My other objective or aim is to make my family proud and also make them feel like it was not a waste of time sending me to school. Also as time goes l would not like to continue serving directly as l would like to be a teacher of microbiologist which has been the agreement my friends and l made as we persue our careers. Without forgetting that it is everyone's wish and aim to become successful in this life we are living.</div></div>
