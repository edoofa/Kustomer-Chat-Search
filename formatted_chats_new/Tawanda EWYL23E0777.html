<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">24/11/23, 13:11 - Ananya:  Great ! Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the "barkless dog" because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a "barroo," due to the shape of its larynx. It's a fascinating trait that sets the Basenji apart from other breeds!</div></div>
