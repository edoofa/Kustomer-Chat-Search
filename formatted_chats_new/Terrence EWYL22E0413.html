I am sure you will agree to the fact that Attitude plays a major role in our day-to-day life. It is also a waste of time if the proper attitude and effective abilities are not developed. In today's Wednesday Wisdom, we discuss a crucial character quality that everyone should work on and make sure they have mastered the right attitude. Once you have read the full lesson, We will be having the discussion concerning the same in our next session. Write down if you have any questions or key observations from the lesson.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 05:42 - Terrence EWYL22E0413:  The key observations from the lesson is attitude. This lesson teaches us to be responsible and not to play the blame game as successfully people do not blame the world when they fail to achieve something. If one wants to achieve something in life they must get to work as things don’t happen magically.</div></div>
