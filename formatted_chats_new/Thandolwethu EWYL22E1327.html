<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">20/07/23, 13:47 - Ananya:  Good morning Thando! How are you doing today?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">20/07/23, 16:03 - Thandolwethu EWYL22E1327:  My inspirational business personality is Mr Alton Ndlovu ,a very prominent business man dominating the transport and logistics business in Zimbabwe. He owns huge haulage trucks, shops and markets. Mr Alton Ndlovu comes from a very poor background. He lost both of his parents at a very tender age, and was left at the care of his abusive brother. He only got education up to the level of Grade Seven, and could not go further than that citing financial problems. He then started to be exposed to child labour, as he ventured into being a farm worker, being paid peanuts, and he left that job. He then worked for a business man as a grinding mill operator, where he almost lost his five fingers. He left that job,  began selling tomatoes in a bucket around the famous Sekusile Business Centre in Bulawayo, Nkulumane. Business was good by then, and he could manage to make extra cash for himself without cheating the owner of tomatoes, but upon suspecting that he was still from her, the owner ended their contract. However, Alton had realised how good is vegetable business,and had developed an interest in it ,all these struggles he underwent were a source of strong motivation for him, he strived to change his way of life, he worked hard to get out of poverty. He started his own vegetable business,expanded his operation into South Africa, developed connections and relations with the white man. When the white man saw the passion, dedication and commitment in him ,they trusted him with their trucks, he started using the trucks to transport his vegetables to Zimbabwe for sale, business went well till he managed to buy one of the trucks. As time went by ,he bought more trucks and today he owns more than 20 big trucks, shops and market buildings. Mr Ndlovu values integrity, hardwork, determination and commitment. He believes that in order for one to succeed in life , they need a combination of the above mentioned factors. Now Mr Ndlovu is paying school fees for some students, he paid for mine from form 1 to 4, and helped me for my form 5 first term studies . He has helped other people to start their own businesses too. What we can learn from his story ,a story of poorest guy in the community who has become a business man,is that it doesn't which background you come from , you only need to work hard , be determined, committed and strategic in your approach.</div></div>
