So, he thinks that the program does not work. I told him that it works and I'll be going this coming August and he told me to go first then he'd accept. Also, I then told him that I can help him connect with my mentor so that he can believe in us as I and my colleagues will be going soon and also some are going month-end of this July</div></div>
