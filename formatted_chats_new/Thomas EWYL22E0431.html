<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">14/12/22, 19:17 - Jasmine Kaur:  Today I have connected with you to talk about something that unites us all. It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognised by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, \"I am a proud Edoofian.\"</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">14/12/22, 19:24 - Thomas EWYL22E0431:  I'm proud to be a part of the Edoofa community.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/02/23, 22:26 - Jasmine Kaur:  There is something that I would like to discuss with you today, it is regarding the responses you have been receiving from our end whenever you greet me by saying “ I am a Proud Edoofian”.

Automated text messaging is one of the easiest ways to stay connected with our large student community and acts as an affirmation of our identity as proud Edoofian. Isn’t it?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">03/02/23, 22:42 - Thomas EWYL22E0431:  Yes</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">03/02/23, 22:44 - Jasmine Kaur:  You would also agree that time is important to everyone, and we realised that close to 70% of discussions had fallouts due to slow responses. Since I have more than 100 students who I am mentoring at the moment, I like to be personally invested in each one’s growth. I was facing a challenge in addressing each and everyone timely. But I wanted to make sure at least each one receive a reiteration of our proud identity from my end as well. Therefore, It was strategically decided to use technology to help us in maintaining our sense of community, keeping our spirits high, and also ensuring I have a maximum time in my day to focus on your skill development and sessions. So we thought of using technology for assistance and hence the idea of using automated responses.</div></div>

Once upon a time, there was a small ant named Andy. Andy was very hardworking and always looked for ways to help his colony. One day, a heavy rain washed away all the food stores for the winter. The other ants were panicking, but Andy came up with a plan. He told them that they needed to work together to gather as much food as possible before the winter came.Every day, Andy worked tirelessly, gathering grains and seeds and bringing them back to the colony. Despite the other ants' initial skepticism, they soon joined in and started to work just as hard as Andy. As a result, they were able to gather enough food to last them through the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The moral of the story is that hard work and determination can help overcome even the most daunting of challenges. If we work together and never give up, we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. Just like Andy and his colony, we too can make a difference in the world by being persistent and never giving up on our dreams.</div></div>
