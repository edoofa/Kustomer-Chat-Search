<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">27/06/23, 11:06 - Thubalami EWYL22E1030:  Two traits of Ellen Johnson which resonate with me are, perseverance and adaptability. Perseverance gives a person the ability to stand against anything with a smile on their face. It has been one of my strengths since Alevel. When having career goals and long term plans, the one with perseverance is able to continue focusing on the goal, even if things tend to go south. However Adaptibility is also a key trait as it allows one to be able to also adjust themselves to match the traits required for the goal set. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is a very perfect role model, when it comes to personal development as from her life, we are able to also learn to develop resilience and Visionary leadership.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">29/06/23, 14:03 - Thubalami EWYL22E1030:  Our Wednesday lesson was about a student named Alex, who lived in Successvile. Alex had a  burning desire to achieve great things like most of us although he was only an average student. After he encountered a book about "the power of identity based habits" in the park his life changed. From reading the book, he got something that l also hadn't learnt before. He found the key to his long desired goal, that is to align one's habits with their desired identity. From the story l find that, it's not just  only about achieving goals  but also about the person you would have become in the process. If you achieve your heartily desired goal but you find out that at that time, you did not grow to become the best version of yourself, you won't get that full satisfaction that you've done it. I also learn that, if l want to achieve great goals, l have to find ways to enjoy the process that leads me to getting there. As l begin enjoying the process, and having the vision of becoming the best version of myself , l begin to attract  others who have the same goals and l am also able to influence others to work on unleashing their true potential also. It's not about what l will accomplish but it's also about who l would have become in the process.</div></div>
