I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. RitualsÂ motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">23/08/22, 04:25 - Tinashe EWYL21E0609:  It was a nice and innovative lesson offered by the Edofian Scholarship program founder Agand Singh whereby we were being shaped our career so that we may become sharp as the sharp edged sword in terms of academics and this can help change the world by being knowledgeable students. One of the quotes mentioned l loved most was the one mentioning the two educations that we have, the one that teaches us how to live and the other how to make a living. I was eye opened to discover that, one with an educative mind tend to find it easier to live due to skills earned which can make one have a better insight and ability to create strategies in making a living. We are learning to change both ourselves and the outer most world on large,  for a better leaving standards  of everyone we need a person who stands supportive and firm and for one to be like that, he or she needs abilities through education. It was really a nice lesson and I'm enjoying the EWYL lessons and that makes me  a proud edofian. Thank you</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/10/22, 21:19 - Saloni Rastogi:  It is important Tinashe that you realize that I have all my time reserved for my students. I feel happy to motivate my students to learn new skills each week and share with me how those lessons have impacted and brought a change in them. And you know what, the way you want to earn scholarship credits and help yourself financially, I am working 10 times more than everyone so that all my students avail the best out of this opportunity. But I feel more saddened for the fact that each time I have to make you realize to follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian', this is something which should be done by you without any reminders.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">10/10/22, 21:20 - Saloni Rastogi:  Most of my time goes on reminding you to follow the daily ritual and keep on pushing you to share your understanding with me on the lessons and activities.

She will be preoccupied with them for a while and won't be able to assist you. Nothing to be concerned about; everything is good at her end, and I also have some wonderful news to share with you. From now on, I, Ms. Saloni, will be your mentor while she is away. I have been coaching students for a long time and am equally happy to be your _companion on this adventure_. Don't worry about your progress so far; I've already been informed of everything. I truly want your _trust_ in me because I feel the two of us can accomplish great things together, and yes, I can see you moving ahead towards a _prosperous future_.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:18 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. RitualsÂ motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
