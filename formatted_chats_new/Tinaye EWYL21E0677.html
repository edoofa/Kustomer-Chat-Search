<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 23:27 - Aditi Kapoor:  Good Afternoon, Tinaye</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 23:27 - Aditi Kapoor:  I am sure that you must have seen your EWYL Group?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 23:29 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677:  I think  a student needs  good communication skills to get in some of the projects to earn more scholarship credits . I personally think that good communication skills is the mist basic requirement that one needs as it enhances productivity if any.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 23:29 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677:  Afternoon  sir</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 23:30 - Tinaye EWYL21E0677:  Yes i have seen it</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">12/07/22, 23:32 - Aditi Kapoor:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

A student like you should never miss out on such opportunities for growth.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
