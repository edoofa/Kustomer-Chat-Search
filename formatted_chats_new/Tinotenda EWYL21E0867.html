<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 18:37 - Tinotenda EWYL21E0867:  My takeaways from the lesson is that we don't have to blame anyone for our failure because sometimes our failure is self inflicted.I also learned that it easy to put a blame on someone that he\/she is behind our failure.  I also learned that people who put blames on others I those who argue that failure is unavoidable. Moreover the most crucial point that inspires me is that if you want something to happen that Is if you Want to succeed get to work, put effort in everything.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/08/22, 17:47 - Aditi Kapoor:  Let me define an Edoofian for you Tinotenda: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group. So starting from today, I want you to text me first thing in the morning- “I am a proud Edoofian”</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/08/22, 17:47 - Aditi Kapoor:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
