We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains! Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. They are associated with more than 90 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA.
