<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">23/01/24, 15:45 - Aditi Kapoor:  Trish, I completely agree with you ‚Äì the principles of Persistence and Resilience from "Think and Grow Rich" are indeed powerful and essential in life's journey. Being persistent, persistently pursuing goals in a determined manner, and showing resilience, the ability to recover quickly from challenges, are key qualities that shape a person's character and contribute to their success. Your example of Sarah Jakes Roberts is truly inspiring, highlighting how these principles can turn adversity into opportunities for growth and positive change. It's a reminder that challenges don't define us; our response to them does. Keep embracing the journey with persistence and resilience ‚Äì it's the path to remarkable achievements!</div></div>
