Some models of problem solving involve identifying a goal and then a sequence of subgoals towards achieving this goal. Today’s Wednesday wisdom will talk about 5 Problem solving strategies by Charlie Munger. Charles Thomas Munger is an American billionaire investor, businessman, and former real estate attorney. He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">15/07/22, 06:40 - Tswatswa EWYL21E0751:  In this week's Wednesday wisdom that was focusing on Patrice Motsepe l was very happy because this man together with Strive Masiyiwa they are my African role models.  Patrice Motsepe  worked so hard to insure that his future is bright , though he became a lawyer he stopped at nothing until his dream of mining business came into reality . This story of Motsepe encourages youths like me to work very hard because we can change the world if we put aside our laziness and have perseverance . Now Motsepe is one of the richest African men because of his hard work , also one thing that  l liked from this is that Patrice waited patiently for his time to enjoy the profits . Honestly I'm really honored to have known much about our African entrepreneurs whom we will always remember because of their hard  work ,  l hope l will also do the same in my life .</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">25/07/22, 03:15 - Unknown:  Hello my Proud Edoofian, hope you are doing well. I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
