Urgency often prompts action.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">21/12/23, 14:05 - Unknown:  Storytelling Magic: Craft stories that resonate with  your audience. Share success stories of individuals who were once in  their shoes, hesitated, but eventually took the leap and are now on the  path to success. Stories inspire action.</div></div>
