<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 16:35 - Vanitor EWYL21E0887:  Wednesday wisdom lesson for 29 june...Entrepreneurship is necessary inorder to initiate the process for economic development especially in developing countries.It is actually the backbone of the economy for any country.Entrepreneurship is a catalyst and an agent of change.However the contributiion of women is actually very important in the social,economioc and political development of a country.Social entrepreneurship refers to  the way individuals come up with solutions to derectly address social issues.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 16:51 - Vanitor EWYL21E0887:  Wednesday wisdom lesson for 6 july we learn about a very young African entrepreneur named Oluwadamiola Soyombo.She is an award winning UI\/UX designer with seven years experience of working  in the technology environment.SHE FOUNDED Skooqs which the first online learning platform where African students can access technology and creative courses at a very young age.In addition she also founded TcKZone which is A NOT FOR PROFIT reaching out to underserved community children with no funds and training them in technology skills,thereby increasin th number of young minds in technology and preparing for the future.Her whole story is actuually quite inspiring because she managed to do all the things that most of us think are very difficult.If she  did it then i also can do it.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">21/07/22, 17:09 - Vanitor EWYL21E0887:  Wednesday wisdom lesson for 20 july.I learnt that it is actually very easy to put the blame on others for whatever that could be happening to you.One can blame the environment for not becoming successful.People have a tendecy to come up with excuses as to why they fail to succeed instead of looking within themselves to see what it is exactly they are doing wrong.On the other hand successful people learn from their mistakes and do something about it inorder to improve.Those who continuosly make up excuses for their failure tend to have a very ugly belief that failure is inevitable,which is very wrong.One has to be careful of how they speak about themselves to other people because at the end of the day you are also listening to yourself so most of tghe things we say end up becoming a self fulfilling prophecy.Successful people are aware of the fact that not putting effort in one's work just results in a losing game.An important note to take is that even if you put in effort now and things continuosly seem to be not working out it means thatyou are paying a price for the years of neglect.To become successful there is a price to pay because things will never happen magically.</div></div>
