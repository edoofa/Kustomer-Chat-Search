<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">13/07/22, 21:53 - Unknown:  In your response, you submitted earlier,  I want to highlight that through this activity my main motive was the make you realize that now you are not just a student but our future entrepreneurs who can figure out the problem and have the courage to solve them. You need to know that efforts made in the right direction can lead to outshining results  Only having a passion for the cause is not necessary, along with efforts we have to efficiently use all the resources around us and make full use of them. Like you have EDOOFA's EWYL program through which you can learn amazing skills, practical knowledge, leadership skills, and whatnot. When we have a vision, we can always find a solution. Remember, we have to make some sacrifices to make our dreams turn into reality and I know, you can achieve all that you have planned. I have full faith in you.</div></div>

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to business competition or project planning. After getting to know what SWOT means, it is very necessary that we imply the same to our business plan\/ventures and raise it to another level of brilliance and competitiveness. My main aim to make you realize behind and beyond your response is that you have all the capabilities and determination to become a future leader.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
