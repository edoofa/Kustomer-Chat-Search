It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves. So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

He had a eye for opportunity and was not afraid of taking risks. He bought a mine which others had rendered almost useless and turned it around I believe he took a risk knowing he would give the opportunity his entire strength. He was hardworking from the start, helping his father in his business and not knowing that would lead him to one day being a billionaire. He would go where he saw opportunities merging with many different successful companies and he didn't let the fact that he was different stop him. He stood among people of different race and made a mark. I believe he is one example of greatness and has inspired me to never give up and to work hard grabbing each opportunity that comes my way.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">19/07/22, 23:15 - Vimbainashe EWYL21E0518:  Zimbabwe as a developing country has many sectors that are fast growing and bringing in lots of profits for the ones operating those sectors. The Agricultural sector is one of these. With many rich business people putting most of their finances in Agriculture and getting a lot more back it is safe to say that Agriculture is fast growing and bringing in lots of money. Zimbabwe has great soil for Farming and vast pieces of fertile land to exploit. Africa in general is mainly based in agriculture and this sector is one sector if one invests in is bound to get something back.</div></div>

I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>
