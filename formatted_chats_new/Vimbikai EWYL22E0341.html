<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">20/10/22, 02:54 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341:  I have a lot of friends who I talked to about edoofa and they are really interested in joining the scholarship program, yes they can afford the 200 enrollment fee,700 registration fee but for the tution fees on indian universities they will only have to rely on EWYLP because of financial instability at home .Is it possible to rely on the EWYLPS ......I'm also concerned about this as a proud edoofian. When doing my community building project I discovered that there are some bad romours about the Edoofa scholarship program which I don't actually believe so we're facing some challenges when talking to headmasters and students as well. I wanted to address that on the call but I failed to connect due to network problems. As one of the proud edoofians I thought of telling you so that we could work best on stopping those false romours so that this program keep on helping many students to achieve their dreams. I have two students who I talked to and they said they once did the counseling and couldn't proceed because of those false romours but I talked to them and reconnected them to my counselor.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">25/08/22, 04:18 - Vimbikai EWYL22E0341:  Identification of skills that make us successful . I have learnt a great lesson today.Its very little things that bring out very great things like what happened to cde Modi who started with 2 pairs of clothes and $50 in his pocket but he built 11 supermarkets out of it though it was a long journey . They were ups and downs throughout the way like when he was ineed of $30 but his boss failed to help him .He ended up quiting the job and working somewhere else . After reading this I have also learnt that sometimes you need to put yourself at risk so that you can be successful like what he did  .if he kept holding on that job he wouldn't have made this far maybe. From Dr Chiyangwa's story I also learned very useful skills of life. Being business minded helped him to reach where he is right now. He started as a vendor first , going to fields buying vegetables and selling . He got employed at New York house.He first introduced himself to the business environment and that way he made it to the end . lessons learned</div></div>

So I was telling him about Edoofa scholarship program and he appreciated that it is a really great program I gave that form that headmasters fill but he suggested to have an online meeting with you without filling the form.
