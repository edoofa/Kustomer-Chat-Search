<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 00:10 - Unknown:  Successful people don’t blame the world when they fail to achieve something. They accept personal responsibility, learn from their mistakes, and then do something about them. They also know that being unwilling to make the effort is a losing game.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 00:26 - Vincent EWYL22E0412:  When we always point something or someone as the reason for our failure, we eventually lose energy to continue trying. This might convince us that failure is bound to befall us without escape and we consequently lose trust in ourselves and begin to undermine our capabilities. Taking full responsibility of our mistakes is the beginning of success.  When we accept our mistakes, we make an effort to correct them. We should not be disheartened when we exert an effort and still do not get desirable outcome for it takes persistence and continuous hardwork for us to be successful.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:17 - Unknown:  Vincent you can share your response on the projects in any order, we can start with the community building project.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:17 - Unknown:  I see Vincent you have typed 3, may I know what challenges you are facing?</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:18 - Unknown:  Let me define an Edoofian for you: A strong individual with a goal to be the voice of the voiceless and a leader for tomorrow is focused on bettering themselves and using their expertise to bring change to their country. Who is willing to put in the effort to make everything work so that his family can be proud of him, and who is responsible and sensible. Only the sky's the limit for a true Edoofian. Now that you know what an Edoofian is, these attributes should run through your mind every time you say I am a Proud Edoofian, filling you with pride that you are already a member of this elite group.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:19 - Unknown:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian in order to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:19 - Unknown:  I hope now you have clarity on what and who a proud edoofian is.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">22/07/22, 04:20 - Vincent EWYL22E0412:  I think that will be a good approach</div></div>
