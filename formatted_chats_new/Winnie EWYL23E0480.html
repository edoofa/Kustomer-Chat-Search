<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">11/09/23, 16:12 - Ananya:  To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!ðŸŽ‰</div></div>

The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that todayâ€™s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as countryâ€™s development/growth._</div></div>
