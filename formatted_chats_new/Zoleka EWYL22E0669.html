<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 21:12 - Saloni Rastogi:  Please follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' for today.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 21:12 - Saloni Rastogi:  This is a simple exercise that we will all perform to become more aware of the value and gift that we have been given, which is the opportunity to be a part of such a close-knit community whose sole purpose is everyone's success. We believe that for a group to be effective, three conditions must exist: member trust, a sense of group identity, and a sense of collective efficacy. We need to develop a habit of greeting each other and mentioning that I am a proud Edoofian to be better connected to the community and to build pride and confidence among ourselves.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 21:16 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669:  I am a proud edoofian good day</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 21:17 - Saloni Rastogi:  Our habits, behavior patterns and how we communicate with others have a lot to say about our efficiency in any project we take up. Simple routine habits like the time you wake up every day are capable of impacting your productivity every day. Therefore, a gentle reminder that you are a proud Edoofian will encourage you to embrace this title and meet our expectations of the leader we see in you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       So do not let this chain break and continue with this habit of saying “I am a Proud Edoofian” daily.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 22:19 - Saloni Rastogi:  May I know what have you understood from it?</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 22:38 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669:  From the Wednesday lesson I learnt that persuasion as an important factor that affect decisions that people make particularly related to sales and purchases. Cialdini identified 6 core principles of persuasion that affect the decision making shortcut. It is believed that if one masters and understands them you can use them to your advantage persuade to others easily  to take a specific action or buy a specific product. The six principles are reciprocity, scarcity, authority, commitment and consistency, liking and consensus (social proof). These can be very useful in my EWYL tasks in persuading fellow students and others.</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 22:42 - Saloni Rastogi:  Your understanding is very impressive Zoleka!</div></div>
<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">06/01/23, 22:43 - Saloni Rastogi:  And yes, that's very true that all this can be very useful to persuade fellow students in becoming proud edoofians.</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">10/01/23, 00:54 - Zoleka EWYL22E0669:  This is a very common question asked to most sales people to find out their character or behaviour in the sales industry. The first thing you do is to find out your customers needs starting by asking  questions like what kind of pen have they used before or what they like to use pens for, this helps the salesman to show them how the pen is different. The salesman has to identify the features of the pen that meets the customers need, once there is a better understanding of the customers needs you can identify features that may appeal to. The salesman has to appeal to the customers emotions , make the customer emotionally attached to the pen because the customer may have a lot of pens so the salesman need to appeal to me customers emotions so the customer buy the pen</div></div>
