<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">02/02/23, 03:46 - Zvikomborero EWYL22E0062:  I remember my first ever national exam was really scary because I got sick during that period . However through the support I got from my family ,friends and teachers i managed to get 4 units . Secondary school also had its own hurdles since schools got closed because of the pandemic Covid 19 . Through tutoring and constant studying in the lock down  I produces 4A's , 5B's  and 2C's in  my  O level. For my A level i got an opportunity to learn at boarding school with a strong reading culture . It was a good experience both mentally and socially , teaching me how to be able to live independently. For my A levels I got 11 points and a pass in communication  skills.                                                                                           I would like to think  that i am a social butterfly and really good at communicating with different kinds of people  . I am a very soft hearted person and I love doing volunteer work     and spreading hope to other people and i learnt all of this in a club called Ray of Hope . I also have a passion for cooking      and singing .                                                                                                                                                              Being a successful  Chattered Accountant   is a goal  that I am very passionate about  and I hope I can further my dream to  the best extent of my capabilities . I also hope to continue with charity and volunteer work so that I can help other people achieve their goals, and also be able to inspire the upcoming generation and my peers  .</div></div>

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">11/02/23, 01:12 - Zvikomborero EWYL22E0062:  Ok so from that document i learnt that it helps  to equip us with the necessary skills needed  to survive in this new  technologica era i think it will also help boost our confidence and gives us a never gibe up attitude when things do not work out. Corporate alliance will help prepare me for the professional industry helping us to gain knowledge business wise before we start working it also help us with creating strong professional connection with different companies .I think that Community building is about helping to improve the community and give other students the same chance i got. African school education reform mission project is about helping improve African education  through connecting them to Edoofa and sharing world class technology and technologies available in I india . All of th above also help sharpening our communication skills.</div></div>
