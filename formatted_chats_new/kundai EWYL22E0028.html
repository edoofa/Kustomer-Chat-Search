I am sure we all understand how important it is to follow our rituals and routine religiously. Rituals motivate and move us. I have seen some of the students do not follow the ritual of saying I am a Proud Edoofian, especially on Sunday. This text is not an obligation but a practice each proud Edoofian should undertake. It is a reminder to self, the achievements you have achieved so far, the strong community that you are part of.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">02/08/22, 15:35 - Unknown:  As an exclusive and growth-oriented student community, we should embrace the spirit of character, image, and pride. It's a sense that people in the community matter to one another, and that their skills and a brighter future will be forged through mutual commitment and cooperation. Being a part of a group does make us feel as if we are a part of something bigger than ourselves.

<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">05/08/22, 23:16 - kundai EWYL22E0028:  The inspiration l got from Gilbert Eugene Peters is that believe in yourself when noone else does not believe in you and eventually you will make it. Another lesson is that age does not matter in the entrepreneurial journey .And also entrepreneurship is not a straight road and success in this journey is often achieved through sweat and blood .Of course there will be obstacles but one needs to add focus to make it in this journey .Some hindrances will lower your confidence but if our hearts can believe it and our minds can conceive it then we can achieve victory ...</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">09/08/22, 22:34 - Unknown:  One can be called successful if they have achieved their desired goals. For some people, being successful means being rich. But being successful is even more than being rich. When you achieve what you want, it gives you immense pleasure, and that is incomparable with being rich. To be successful in any aspect of life, one needs to have strong dedication and work hard.</div></div>

<br><div class="message right"><div class="sender">09/08/22, 23:27 - Unknown:  Please share your understanding Kundai, I am very excited to discuss with you.</div></div>
<br><div class="message left"><div class="sender">09/08/22, 23:39 - kundai EWYL22E0028:  While being successful means being rich to others,it may also mean the achieving your dreams and goals as an individual.After achieving your goals the great feeling coming from that is nothing compared to being rich...the self satisfaction you get cannot be compared to having a lot of money.Also hard work and dedication lead to one being successful</div></div>
